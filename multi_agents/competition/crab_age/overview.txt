## Evaluation

Submissions will be evaluated using [Mean Absolute Error (MAE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_absolute_error),

![MAE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/visipedia/iwildcam_comp/master/assets/MAE.png)

where each `x_i` represents the predicted target, `y_i` represents the ground truth, and `n` is the number of rows in the test set.

## Submission File

For each `id` in the test set, you must predict the target `Age`. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
id,yield
74051,10.2
74051,3.6
74051,11.9
etc.
```

## Dataset Description

The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the [Crab Age Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sidhus/crab-age-prediction)dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.

**Note:** You can use [this notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/inversion/make-synthetic-crab-age-data) to generate additional synthetic data for this competition if you would like.

## Files

- **train.csv** - the training dataset; `Age` is the target
- **test.csv** - the test dataset; your objective is to predict the probability of `Age` (the ground truth is `int` but you can predict `int` or `float`)
- **sample_submission.csv** - a sample submission file in the correct format
