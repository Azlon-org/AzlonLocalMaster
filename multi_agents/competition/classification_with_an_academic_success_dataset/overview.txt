# Classification with an Academic Success Dataset

Playground Series - Season 4, Episode 6

![](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/73290/images/header)

## Overview

**Welcome to the 2024 Kaggle Playground Series!** We plan to continue in the spirit of previous playgrounds, providing interesting an approachable datasets for our community to practice their machine learning skills, and anticipate a competition each month.

**Your Goal:** The goal of this competition is to predict academic risk of students in higher education.

### Evaluation

Submissions are evaluated using the [accuracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision) score.

## Submission File

For each `id` row in the test set, you must predict the class value of the `Target`, which is a categorical academic risk assessment. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
id,Target
76518,Graduate
76519,Graduate
76520,Graduate
etc.
```

### About the Tabular Playground Series

The goal of the Tabular Playground Series is to provide the Kaggle community with a variety of fairly light-weight challenges that can be used to learn and sharpen skills in different aspects of machine learning and data science. The duration of each competition will generally only last a few weeks, and may have longer or shorter durations depending on the challenge. The challenges will generally use fairly light-weight datasets that are synthetically generated from real-world data, and will provide an opportunity to quickly iterate through various model and feature engineering ideas, create visualizations, etc.

### Synthetically-Generated Datasets

Using synthetic data for Playground competitions allows us to strike a balance between having real-world data (with named features) and ensuring test labels are not publicly available. This allows us to host competitions with more interesting datasets than in the past. While there are still challenges with synthetic data generation, the state-of-the-art is much better now than when we started the Tabular Playground Series two years ago, and that goal is to produce datasets that have far fewer artifacts. Please feel free to give us feedback on the datasets for the different competitions so that we can continue to improve!

### Prizes

- 1st Place - Choice of Kaggle merchandise
- 2nd Place - Choice of Kaggle merchandise
- 3rd Place - Choice of Kaggle merchandise

**Please note:** In order to encourage more participation from beginners, Kaggle merchandise will only be awarded once per person in this series. If a person has previously won, we'll skip to the next team.

## Dataset Description

The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the [Predict Students' Dropout and Academic Success](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success) dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance. Please refer to the original dataset for feature feature explanations.

## Files

- **train.csv** - the training dataset; `Target` is the categorical target
- **test.csv** - the test dataset; your objective is to predict the class of `Target` for each row
- **sample_submission.csv** - a sample submission file in the correct format
