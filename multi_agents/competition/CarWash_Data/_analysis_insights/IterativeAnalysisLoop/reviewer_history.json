However, the plan and execution insufficiently acknowledge potential biases introduced by dropping records with missing critical IDs and imputing categorical data as 'Unknown,' which could distort insights if unmitigated. Additionally, the absence of early exploratory data analyses and uncertainty quantification limits robustness and delays actionable findings. To improve, explicitly incorporate bias assessment and mitigation strategies, embed iterative validation loops, and specify concrete root cause analysis methods (e.g., data lineage audits). Providing interim visualizations and preliminary insights will strengthen stakeholder engagement and operational relevance.
