## QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS  

### Question 1  
What files did you process? Which files were generated? Answer with detailed file path.  
### Answer 1  
The phase processed two key files located in the directory `multi_agents/competition/CarWash_Data/`:  
- `bookings.csv`  
- `transactions.csv`  

No output files were generated during this phase. The script focused on analysis and printing summaries related to future-dated timestamps but did not save any flagged datasets or summary outputs to disk.

### Question 2  
Which features were involved in this phase? What changes did they undergo? If any feature types were modified, answer which features are modified and how they are modified. If any features were deleted or created, answer which features are deleted or created and provide detailed explanations.  
### Answer 2  
The features involved were primarily timestamp-related columns from the two datasets:  

- For `bookings.csv`, candidate timestamp columns included:  
  - `booking_datetime`  
  - `booking_date`  
  - `created_at`  
  - `timestamp`  

- For `transactions.csv`, candidate timestamp columns included:  
  - `transaction_datetime`  
  - `transaction_date`  
  - `created_at`  
  - `timestamp`  

Changes undergone:  
- Temporary datetime parsing columns were created (suffixed `_parsed`) to convert string timestamps into pandas datetime objects for validation; these temporary columns were dropped after checks.  
- For rows identified with future-dated timestamps, boolean flag columns were added with the suffix `_is_future` (e.g., `booking_datetime_is_future`) to mark these records.  
- No feature types were permanently changed; timestamp columns were only temporarily parsed for validation.  
- No features were deleted or newly created beyond these temporary and flag columns during script execution.  
- No modifications related to operators, services, or promotions occurred in this phase.

### Question 3  
What were the key data quality issues identified during the iterative analysis, and how were they addressed or flagged?  
### Answer 3  
Key data quality issues identified included:  
- Presence of future-dated timestamps in both `bookings` and `transactions` datasets, indicating potential errors or system clock issues.  
- Some timestamp entries were unparsable and coerced to `NaT`, with counts and percentages reported.  

How they were addressed or flagged:  
- Rows containing future timestamps were flagged by newly added boolean columns (`*_is_future`).  
- Summaries were printed showing counts and percentages of unparsable and future-dated timestamps.  
- Grouping summaries highlighted top booking or transaction IDs associated with future timestamp occurrences.  
- No corrections, deletions, or imputations were applied; the data quality issues were surfaced for further handling in subsequent phases.

### Question 4  
Which service packages and extra services demonstrated the most significant impact on transaction volume, revenue, and customer satisfaction?  
### Answer 4  
No analysis or results related to service packages or extra services were conducted or reported in this phase.

---

### Question 5  
How did operator characteristics—such as document verification status, availability, and compensation—relate to booking success, cancellations, and performance metrics?  
### Answer 5  
No operator-related analysis was performed during this phase.

---

### Question 6  
What patterns and correlations were found regarding booking issues, their resolution times, and effects on customer retention and repeat bookings?  
### Answer 6  
No analysis on booking issues, resolution times, or their effects on customer retention was conducted in this phase.

---

### Question 7  
What customer segmentation insights and behavior patterns emerged, especially concerning promotion usage, booking frequency, and retention?  
### Answer 7  
This phase did not include any customer segmentation or behavior pattern analysis.

---

### Question 8  
How effective were promotions, discounts, and Quick Bucks in influencing transaction volume, revenue, and repeat usage? What potential cannibalization or unintended effects were observed?  
### Answer 8  
No analysis regarding promotions, discounts, or Quick Bucks effectiveness was carried out during this phase.
