## QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS  

### Question 1  
What files did you process? Which files were generated? Answer with detailed file path.  
### Answer 1  
The following raw datasets were processed from the directory `multi_agents/competition/CarWash_Data/`:  
- `orders.csv`  
- `operators.csv`  
- `customers.csv` (equivalent to `clients.csv`)  
- `services.csv`  
- `transactions.csv`  

No new files were generated or saved during this phase; all outputs were console-based data quality reports.

### Question 2  
Which features were involved in this phase? What changes did they undergo? If any feature types were modified, answer which features are modified and how they are modified. If any features were deleted or created, answer which features are deleted or created and provide detailed explanations.  
### Answer 2  
Key features involved spanned across the datasets including:  
- From `orders.csv`: `order_date`, `operator_id`, `customer_id` and others.  
- From `operators.csv`: `operator_id` and related performance indicators.  
- From `customers.csv`: `customer_id` and client profile attributes.  
- From `services.csv` and `transactions.csv`: service and payment-related fields.

The only feature type modification was parsing `order_date` from string to datetime for validation. No features were deleted or newly created. Although missing values and inconsistencies were identified, no imputations or deletions were applied at this stage.

### Question 3  
What are the key data quality issues identified (e.g., missing values, corruption, bias) in critical datasets such as `clients.csv`, `orders.csv`, and `operators.csv`? How were these issues addressed, and what residual impacts might remain for final analysis?  
### Answer 3  
Key data quality issues identified include:  
- Missing values in multiple columns across datasets.  
- Referential integrity problems where some `operator_id`s and `customer_id`s referenced in `orders.csv` do not exist in `operators.csv` or `customers.csv`.  
- Invalid or missing `order_date` entries, including some dates set in the future.  
- Presence of negative values and zero values in numeric fields related to pricing and durations, which may be illogical or indicate refunds.

These issues were documented and quantified but not corrected or imputed in this phase. The residual impacts could bias subsequent analyses, especially time series and revenue calculations, unless properly handled in later phases.

### Question 4  
What major patterns or trends emerged from exploratory data analyses related to booking frequency, revenue streams, operator performance, and customer payment behaviors? Which findings are most relevant for strategic decision-making?  
### Answer 4  
No exploratory data analyses or visualizations were generated in this phase. Therefore, no patterns, trends, or strategic insights were extracted yet. The focus remained on data quality validation as a prerequisite for reliable analysis.

---

### Question 5  
How were operator performance and workforce utilization characterized, particularly regarding verification status, penalties, cancellations, and compensation? What implications do these findings have for operational improvements?  
### Answer 5  
Operator performance and workforce utilization analyses were planned but not executed during this phase. No characterizations or findings related to verification status, penalties, cancellations, or compensation were produced.

---

### Question 6  
What customer segments were identified based on behavior and transactional profiles? How was data completeness and imputation uncertainty incorporated into these segments, and which segments warrant focused attention for retention or marketing?  
### Answer 6  
Customer segmentation based on behavior and transactional data was planned but not performed in this phase. While data completeness was quantified, no imputations or uncertainty assessments were incorporated, and no specific customer segments were defined or prioritized.

---

### Question 7  
Which advanced analytics or predictive models were developed (e.g., for cancellations, churn), and how were bias adjustments and uncertainty quantification integrated? What are the key modeling outcomes that should be highlighted?  
### Answer 7  
No advanced analytics or predictive modeling was conducted in this phase. Model building and bias or uncertainty integration were planned for future phases.
