## QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS  

### Question 1  
What files did you process? Which files were generated? Answer with detailed file path.

### Answer 1  
The phase processed three primary CSV datasets located in the directory `multi_agents/competition/CarWash_Data`:  
- `orders.csv`  
- `clients.csv`  
- `operators.csv`  

No new data files or output files were generated in this phase. The phase focused on data ingestion, validation, and cleaning without producing new output files.

### Question 2  
Which features were involved in this phase? What changes did they undergo? If any feature types were modified, answer which features are modified and how they are modified. If any features were deleted or created, answer which features are deleted or created and provide detailed explanations.

### Answer 2  
Features involved spanned across the three datasets:  
- From `orders.csv`: service package details, promo codes, revenue, booking counts, operator codes, payment methods (implied).  
- From `clients.csv`: booking frequency, payment preferences including wallet usage (`QuickBucks`), promo code adoption.  
- From `operators.csv`: operator IDs, verification status, compensation, penalties, cancellations.

Changes included:  
- Removal of duplicate rows across all datasets to ensure data integrity.  
- Identification and flagging of missing values, particularly in critical linkage keys such as IDs and verification fields.  
- Notes and checks around categorical variable cardinality and data type consistency, although no explicit type conversions were performed.  
- No features were deleted or newly created during this phase; the focus was on cleaning existing data.

### Question 3  
What key data quality issues were identified and resolved during the IterativeAnalysisLoop?

### Answer 3  
Key data quality issues addressed:  
- Duplicate records identified and removed from all three datasets.  
- Missing values especially in critical ID columns were detected and flagged for further investigation.  
- High cardinality in certain categorical columns was noted as a potential issue.  
- Robust handling of data ingestion errors including missing files or parsing problems ensured stable loading.  
- While duplicates were removed and issues flagged, missing values were not yet imputed or fully resolved in this phase.

### Question 4  
Which service packages, extra services, and promo codes showed significant patterns in terms of popularity, revenue contribution, and cross-selling opportunities?

### Answer 4  
No explicit analyses or findings regarding service packages, extra services, or promo codes were conducted or reported during this phase. The strategic plan includes these analyses as goals, but the current phase focused mainly on data quality and preparation.

---

### Question 5  
What were the main findings regarding operator performance, verification status, and compensation fairness?

### Answer 5  
No direct analysis or results related to operator performance, verification status, or compensation fairness were produced in this phase. This aspect remains planned for future work beyond the current data cleaning stage.

---

### Question 6  
How did customer payment behaviors and segmentation analyses inform understanding of client profiles and promo code effectiveness?

### Answer 6  
Customer segmentation and payment behavior analyses were not performed in this phase. These analyses are part of the planned future work following data preparation.

---

### Question 7  
What recurring booking issues, communication patterns, and operational bottlenecks were discovered, and what preliminary suggestions emerged for process improvements?

### Answer 7  
No analyses or insights into booking issues, communication patterns, or operational bottlenecks were conducted or reported during this phase.

---

### Question 8  
Which KPIs and dashboards were developed or identified as critical to monitor ongoing performance, and what gaps or risks remain to be addressed in the final insights?

### Answer 8  
No KPIs or dashboards were developed during this phase. The strategic plan identifies KPI and dashboard development as critical next steps.  
Key data gaps and risks identified include missing operator verification data, incomplete bookings, and potential biases due to data incompleteness. These will require attention in subsequent phases.
