- **Data Quality and Integrity Validation**  
  - Complete root cause analysis for corrupted or missing critical datasets (`clients.csv`, `orders.csv`, `operators.csv`) by engaging with data engineering or source system teams.  
  - Quantify and document bias introduced by dropping rows with missing critical IDs and imputing categorical variables as `'Unknown'`. Explore alternative imputation or data augmentation strategies.  
  - Implement iterative validation loops to monitor data quality improvements and impact on downstream analyses.  

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  - Conduct detailed EDA on cleaned datasets focusing on:  
    - Booking frequency trends over time, including seasonality and growth patterns.  
    - Revenue breakdown by service package and extra services uptake, identifying top contributors and pricing anomalies (e.g., refunds or zero/negative prices).  
    - Operator availability, job completion rates, cancellation patterns, and compensation distribution.  
    - Client payment behavior, including Quick Bucks credit usage and card payment methods.  
  - Visualize missing data patterns and outlier distributions to guide further cleaning or modeling decisions.

- **Operator Performance and Workforce Utilization Analysis**  
  - Analyze operator utilization metrics relative to availability and compensation schemes.  
  - Evaluate the impact of operator verification status, penalties, and cancellations on performance outcomes and customer satisfaction.  
  - Assess fairness and effectiveness of compensation adjustments and bonuses.

- **Customer Segmentation and Behavior Profiling**  
  - Develop customer segments based on transactional behavior, service usage, and booking frequency.  
  - Incorporate data completeness and imputation uncertainty into segmentation robustness checks.  
  - Identify high-value and at-risk customer groups to inform targeted marketing or retention strategies.

- **Booking Quality and Issue Resolution**  
  - Leverage pre-wash checklist data (including images) to assess service quality compliance and identify common quality issues.  
  - Analyze booking issues and compensation logs to detect operational bottlenecks and areas for process improvement.  
  - Evaluate customer-operator communication effectiveness via chat and notification logs, focusing on responsiveness and resolution rates.

- **Marketing and Promotion Effectiveness**  
  - Measure the uptake and revenue impact of promo codes and extra services linked to promotions.  
  - Analyze push notification campaign reach, engagement, and conversion by customer segment.  
  - Test hypotheses on promotional effectiveness and refine marketing targeting accordingly.

- **Advanced Analytics and Predictive Modeling**  
  - Build predictive models for booking cancellations, no-shows, and customer churn using enriched and cleaned datasets.  
  - Apply clustering or classification techniques to refine customer and operator segments.  
  - Incorporate uncertainty quantification and bias adjustment in modeling to enhance robustness.

- **Documentation and Communication**  
  - Maintain clear documentation of data cleaning decisions, biases, and assumptions for transparency.  
  - Prepare interim reports with visualizations and preliminary findings to engage stakeholders and guide iterative analysis.  
  - Establish data lineage and quality monitoring frameworks for ongoing operational analytics support.
