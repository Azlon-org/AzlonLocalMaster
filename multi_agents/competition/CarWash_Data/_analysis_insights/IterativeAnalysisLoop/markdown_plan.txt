# High-Level Strategic Analysis Plan for QuickWash Data

1. **Prioritize Data Quality and Temporal Consistency Checks**  
   - Identify and systematically clean or flag future-dated timestamps across all relevant tables, especially bookings and transactions.  
   - Address missing, invalid, or inconsistent data in key fields (e.g., service packages, prices, operator IDs).  
   - Implement bias detection strategies to identify and mitigate confirmation bias or sampling biases, particularly in operator-client interactions and promotions data.

2. **In-Depth Service Package and Extra Services Analysis**  
   - Quantify transaction volume, revenue, and average price by service package and by extra service.  
   - Analyze bundling patterns: which extras are frequently purchased with which packages.  
   - Test hypothesis: Extras significantly increase average transaction revenue and customer satisfaction.  
   - Explore temporal trends and seasonality in package and extra service sales to inform marketing timing and inventory/planning.

3. **Operator Performance and Availability Evaluation**  
   - Analyze operator availability patterns versus completed jobs and cancellations.  
   - Assess impact of operator document verification status on booking success and service quality.  
   - Examine operator compensation, penalties, and their correlation with performance metrics (e.g., cancellations, customer ratings).  
   - Test hypothesis: Verified operators have higher booking success rates and fewer penalties.

4. **Booking Issues and Resolution Dynamics**  
   - Categorize and quantify booking issues by type (e.g., client no-show, operator unable to complete).  
   - Analyze correlation between booking issues and service packages, operators, and clients.  
   - Evaluate resolution times and impact on customer retention and repeat bookings.  
   - Investigate the role of communication patterns (chat/messages) in resolving booking issues.

5. **Customer Behavior, Segmentation, and Retention Analysis**  
   - Segment customers by booking frequency, service preferences, and promotion usage.  
   - Analyze lead sources and acquisition channels effectiveness in driving high-value customers.  
   - Assess usage and impact of Quick Bucks credits and promocodes on repeat bookings and lifetime value.  
   - Test hypothesis: Customers using promotions or Quick Bucks exhibit different retention patterns.

6. **Promotions and Discounts Effectiveness**  
   - Measure promocode usage rates and their impact on transaction volume and revenue.  
   - Analyze whether discounts on extra services increase uptake rates and overall transaction value.  
   - Evaluate repeat usage of promotions and potential cannibalization effects.

7. **Communication and Support Interaction Insights**  
   - Analyze chat and message logs to uncover common customer support issues.  
   - Correlate communication volume and content with booking issues and cancellations.  
   - Identify opportunities to improve customer support and reduce booking failures.

8. **Operational Constraints and Incentives Impact**  
   - Assess how maximum daily job limits and cancellation penalties influence operator scheduling and behavior.  
   - Analyze customer satisfaction and booking success relative to these operational policies.

9. **Financial Flow and Compensation Trends**  
   - Examine Quick Bucks (credit/debit) activities to understand customer incentives and liabilities.  
   - Track operator compensation trends over time and relationship to performance and penalties.

10. **Cross-Domain Data Integration and Predictive Modeling Preparation**  
    - Integrate datasets across operators, clients, bookings, promotions, and communications to enable holistic modeling.  
    - Engineer features for predictive tasks such as booking cancellations, operator no-shows, and customer churn.  
    - Plan validation experiments to confirm causality in observed correlations (e.g., extras → price, promotions → retention).

11. **Deliverable and Visualization Strategy**  
    - Develop interactive dashboards highlighting key KPIs such as revenue by package, operator performance metrics, booking issue trends, and promotion effectiveness.  
    - Prepare executive summaries and technical appendices for stakeholders and data science teams.  
    - Document data cleaning steps and assumptions transparently.
