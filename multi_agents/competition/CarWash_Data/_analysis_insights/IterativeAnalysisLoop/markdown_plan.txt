- **Data Cleaning and Validation**  
  - Develop robust parsers to repair corrupted files (`clients.csv`, `orders.csv`, `operators.csv`), handling delimiter inconsistencies, malformed lines, and embedded JSON extraction.  
  - Validate and clean critical identifier fields (`client_id`, `operator_id`, `order_id`), quantifying missingness and assessing impact of dropping or imputing missing IDs.  
  - Standardize and parse date/time fields, coercing invalid entries to missing and documenting their prevalence.  
  - Remove duplicate records and flag potential outliers (e.g., negative pricing) for correction or exclusion.  
  - Document all cleaning steps, data loss, and potential biases introduced for transparency.

- **Bias Assessment and Mitigation**  
  - Quantify bias risks from dropping records with missing critical IDs and imputing categorical missing values as `'Unknown'`.  
  - Conduct sensitivity analyses comparing dropped vs. retained records to detect systematic differences.  
  - Explore alternative imputation strategies or partial record usage to preserve representativeness.  
  - Incorporate uncertainty quantification to account for data quality limitations in downstream analyses.  
  - Transparently report these biases and uncertainties in all analytical outputs.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  - Profile booking frequency, service package popularity, and revenue contribution, including extra services uptake.  
  - Analyze operator performance metrics: availability, job completion rates, cancellations, penalties, and compensation fairness.  
  - Examine customer financial behavior: credit usage (`quick_bucks`), payment method preferences, and spending patterns.  
  - Investigate booking issues and compensation claims, linking to pre-wash checklist adherence for quality control insights.  
  - Evaluate promo code usage and push notification effectiveness across customer segments.  
  - Analyze communication logs (chat, notifications) to assess support responsiveness and correlate with booking outcomes.

- **Segmentation and Profiling**  
  - Perform customer segmentation based on transactional behavior, booking patterns, credit usage, and promotion responsiveness, integrating uncertainty from missing or imputed data.  
  - Segment operators by verification status, performance metrics, and compliance with penalty policies.  
  - Validate segments for stability under different data cleaning and imputation scenarios.

- **Hypothesis Testing and Modeling**  
  - Test hypotheses linking operator verification and penalties to cancellation rates and booking outcomes.  
  - Develop predictive models for booking cancellations, operator no-shows, and customer churn, incorporating bias and uncertainty considerations.  
  - Evaluate model robustness via sensitivity analyses and iterative validation using cleaned and imputed datasets.

- **Operational and Marketing Insights**  
  - Identify operational bottlenecks and workforce utilization inefficiencies from performance and issue tracking analyses.  
  - Assess marketing campaign ROI through promo code redemption and push notification engagement analyses.  
  - Correlate quality assurance adherence (pre-wash checklists) with dispute rates and customer satisfaction.

- **Root Cause Analysis and Governance**  
  - Collaborate with data engineering teams to investigate root causes of data corruption and missing values (e.g., data lineage audits).  
  - Establish automated data quality monitoring and alerting frameworks for ongoing operational reliability.  
  - Embed iterative validation loops in the analysis workflow to continually refine data quality and analytical models.

- **Reporting and Communication**  
  - Produce interim visualizations and summaries to engage stakeholders early and facilitate feedback.  
  - Clearly document data limitations, cleaning impacts, bias assessments, and uncertainty quantification to contextualize findings.  
  - Prioritize actionable insights aligned with QuickWashâ€™s strategic goals, emphasizing transparency and operational relevance.
