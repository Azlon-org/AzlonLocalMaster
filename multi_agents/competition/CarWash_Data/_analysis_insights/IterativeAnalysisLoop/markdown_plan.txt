# QuickWash Data Analysis Strategic Plan

1. **Data Quality and Preparation**
   - Identify and resolve data ingestion issues with critical datasets (`orders.csv`, `clients.csv`, `operators.csv`).
   - Clean and standardize categorical variables (promo codes, payment methods, operator codes).
   - Impute or handle missing values thoughtfully, especially in linkage keys and verification fields.
   - Remove or reconcile duplicate records to ensure data integrity.
   - Investigate numeric outliers in revenue, booking counts, and compensation figures to determine validity.
   - Validate linkage keys across datasets to enable accurate joins and integrated analysis.
   - Document data limitations and potential biases arising from incomplete or inconsistent data (e.g., operator verification gaps).

2. **Service Package and Pricing Analysis**
   - Analyze popularity and revenue contribution of each service package and extra service.
   - Evaluate pricing tiers relative to service duration and customer uptake patterns.
   - Assess promo code usage rates and their impact on sales volume and revenue.
   - Test hypothesis: Promo codes significantly increase uptake of specific packages or extras.
   - Explore cross-selling opportunities by analyzing combinations of packages and extra services purchased.

3. **Operator Performance and Efficiency**
   - Assess operator availability vs. actual bookings and completed jobs to identify under- or over-utilization.
   - Analyze operator compensation, penalties, and cancellations to evaluate fairness and efficiency.
   - Correlate operator document verification status with service quality indicators and complaint rates.
   - Test hypothesis: Verified operators have lower cancellation rates and higher customer satisfaction.
   - Study the impact of operator scheduling and payout settings on job completion and revenue.

4. **Customer Payment Behavior and Segmentation**
   - Investigate usage patterns of client wallets (`QuickBucks`) versus card payments.
   - Analyze promo code adoption across customer segments.
   - Segment customers by booking frequency, payment method preference, and promo code usage.
   - Test hypothesis: Frequent customers rely more on wallet credits and promo codes than infrequent users.

5. **Booking Operations and Issue Management**
   - Explore common booking issues, their frequency, and resolution times.
   - Analyze booking notes qualitatively to identify recurring themes affecting service quality.
   - Examine pre-wash checklist adherence and its relationship with booking issues and customer complaints.
   - Identify operational bottlenecks and propose process improvements based on issue patterns.

6. **Communication and Notification Effectiveness**
   - Analyze volume and content of chats between clients, operators, and admins to assess communication quality.
   - Evaluate the effectiveness of push and system notifications on customer engagement and booking rates.
   - Study operatorsâ€™ notification preferences and responsiveness.
   - Test hypothesis: Enhanced communication correlates with higher booking completion and customer satisfaction.

7. **KPI and Dashboard Development**
   - Develop data quality KPIs: missing value rates, duplicate counts, outlier summaries.
   - Create dashboards to monitor:
     - Service package performance and revenue trends.
     - Operator efficiency metrics and compensation reports.
     - Customer segments and payment behaviors.
     - Booking issue frequencies and resolution statuses.
     - Communication volumes and response times.
   - Include filters for time periods, operator segments, customer demographics, and service types.

8. **Risk Assessment and Bias Mitigation**
   - Explicitly assess risks related to data incompleteness, especially missing operator verifications and incomplete bookings.
   - Evaluate potential biases introduced by data gaps in performance and customer behavior analyses.
   - Incorporate sensitivity analyses to measure robustness of findings.
   - Document limitations clearly for informed decision-making.

9. **Quick-Win Analyses**
   - Identify and perform early analyses on clean, reliable subsets of data to generate initial business insights.
   - Present preliminary findings to stakeholders to build momentum and guide iterative analysis.
   - Use quick wins to refine hypotheses and prioritize deeper, more complex analyses.

10. **Iterative Review and Refinement**
    - Continuously revisit data quality and completeness as deeper analyses proceed.
    - Update hypotheses and analysis priorities based on emerging insights.
    - Engage stakeholders regularly to align analysis focus with business objectives and operational needs.
