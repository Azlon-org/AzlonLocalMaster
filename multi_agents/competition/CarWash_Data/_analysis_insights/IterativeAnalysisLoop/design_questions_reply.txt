# Designed Questions for Transition from IterativeAnalysisLoop to FinalInsightCompilation

1. **Which files and datasets were processed during the IterativeAnalysisLoop phase, and what were the key outputs or intermediate files generated? Please provide detailed file paths and descriptions.**  
   *Purpose:* This question ensures a clear record of all data inputs and outputs during this phase, enabling traceability and reproducibility in the FinalInsightCompilation phase.

2. **What were the main data cleaning and validation steps applied, specifically regarding corrupted files, missing critical IDs, date/time standardization, duplicate removal, and outlier handling? How did these steps affect data completeness and quality?**  
   *Purpose:* To summarize the data preparation rigor, quantify data loss or corrections, and provide transparency on data quality for downstream interpretation and reporting.

3. **What types of biases and uncertainties were identified as a result of data cleaning and imputation strategies? How were these biases quantified and mitigated, and what recommendations exist for incorporating uncertainty in final analyses?**  
   *Purpose:* To capture the bias assessment outcomes and guide how uncertainty should be documented and communicated in the final insights.

4. **Which key exploratory data analysis findings—such as customer segmentation, operator performance patterns, booking behaviors, and marketing campaign effectiveness—emerged during this phase? What are the strongest actionable insights discovered?**  
   *Purpose:* To highlight the most relevant analytical findings that should be emphasized or further refined in the final report.

5. **How stable and robust were the customer and operator segmentations, predictive models, and hypothesis tests under different data cleaning and imputation scenarios? What validation or sensitivity analyses were conducted?**  
   *Purpose:* To ensure the final insights are grounded in validated and resilient analyses, and to identify any caveats or limitations to be communicated.

6. **What operational bottlenecks, quality assurance issues, and marketing ROI findings were uncovered? How should these be prioritized or contextualized in the FinalInsightCompilation to align with QuickWash’s strategic goals?**  
   *Purpose:* To frame the operational and strategic implications of the analysis and guide the emphasis of final recommendations for stakeholders.

These questions collectively summarize the comprehensive work done during the IterativeAnalysisLoop phase and provide clear guidance on synthesizing, validating, and prioritizing findings for the FinalInsightCompilation phase.
