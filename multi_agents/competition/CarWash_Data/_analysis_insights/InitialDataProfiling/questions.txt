## QUESTIONS
### Question 1
What files and datasets did you profile in this phase? Were there any data quality issues such as missing values, parsing errors, or inconsistent records that need to be addressed before deeper analysis?

### Question 2
Which features were involved in this phase? What changes did they undergo? If any feature types were modified, answer which features are modified and how they are modified. If any features were deleted or created, answer which features are deleted or created and provide detailed explanations. (This is a FIXED question for each phase.)

### Question 3
What patterns or anomalies emerged in terms of missing data, outliers, or unusual distributions across core dimensions such as operator performance, booking issues, and customer behavior?

### Question 4
Based on initial profiling, which operational or customer behavior metrics appear most promising for further detailed exploration (e.g., popular service packages, booking cancellation trends, promocode usage)?

### Question 5
Are there preliminary indications of relationships or correlations (e.g., between operator availability and booking success, promotion usage and repeat bookings) that should be validated or modeled iteratively?

### Question 6
What data preparation or enhancement steps (e.g., handling missing values, outlier treatment, feature encoding) are recommended before starting the iterative analysis to ensure robust and scalable modeling?
