# QuickWash Data Analysis Phase: Strategic Plan

1. **Data Quality and Preparation**
   - Repair and validate corrupted critical datasets (`clients.csv`, `orders.csv`, `operators.csv`, `operator_balance.csv`, `activity_logs.csv`) to enable reliable analysis.
   - Integrate datasets to create unified views of customers, operators, bookings, and financial transactions.

2. **Revenue and Service Usage Analysis**
   - Analyze booking frequency and trends by service package and geographic/temporal segments.
   - Quantify revenue contribution and profitability per service package and extra service combination.
   - Identify patterns in upselling extra services and the impact on average order value.

3. **Operator Performance and Workforce Management**
   - Assess operator availability vs. actual completed jobs to evaluate utilization rates.
   - Analyze operator compensation patterns relative to performance metrics and cancellations.
   - Investigate cancellation causes and penalties to identify operational risks and opportunities for improvement.
   - Examine operator document verification status and its correlation with performance or complaints.

4. **Customer Segmentation and Behavior**
   - Segment customers based on booking frequency, spending, credit (Quick Bucks) usage, and promo code redemption.
   - Analyze payment method preferences and transaction behaviors from stored payment card data.
   - Identify high-value or at-risk customer segments for targeted marketing or retention efforts.

5. **Operational Quality and Issue Resolution**
   - Evaluate booking issues and complaint logs to detect common problems and their root causes.
   - Review compensation cases in relation to issue types and operator involvement.
   - Use pre-wash checklists, photos, and signatures to assess compliance with quality standards and reduce disputes.

6. **Marketing Effectiveness**
   - Measure promo code uptake, frequency, and impact on booking volume and revenue.
   - Analyze push notification campaigns for open rates, engagement, and conversion to bookings.
   - Correlate chat interactions and customer support responsiveness with customer satisfaction and repeat usage.

7. **Governance and System Settings Impact**
   - Examine how operator commission rates, payout methods, and verification requirements influence operator behavior and retention.
   - Review role and permission structures to identify potential bottlenecks or security risks in system access.

8. **Actionable Insights Development**
   - Synthesize findings into actionable recommendations for business optimization in pricing, marketing, operator management, and customer experience.
   - Prioritize initiatives based on impact potential and data confidence levels.
