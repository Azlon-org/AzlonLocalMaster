# QuickWash Data Analysis Strategic Plan

- **Data Preparation and Quality Assurance**
  - Resolve ingestion and read errors for critical files: `orders.csv`, `clients.csv`, `operators.csv`.
  - Perform data cleaning, deduplication, and validation across all datasets.
  - Establish data linkage keys (e.g., user IDs, booking IDs, operator codes) for cross-dataset analysis.

- **Service Package and Pricing Analysis**
  - Which service packages are most frequently booked and generate the highest revenue?
  - How do extra services affect overall sales and customer preferences?

  - Analyze pricing structures relative to service durations and customer segments.
  - Identify opportunities for bundling or adjusting pricing to maximize profitability.

- **Operator Performance and Utilization**
  - What is the correlation between operator availability schedules and actual bookings completed?
  - Analyze operator compensation patterns and their relationship to job completion rates and cancellations.
  - Assess the impact of operator verification status (document verification) on service quality and complaint rates.
  - Identify operators with consistently high or low performance metrics for targeted interventions.

- **Customer Payment and Wallet Behavior**
  - How frequently do customers use QuickBucks wallet credits versus payment cards?
  - Analyze the distribution and redemption of promo codes among different customer segments.

- **Operational and Strategic Insights Integration**
  - Cross-analyze operator availability, compensation, and booking success to optimize workforce scheduling.
  - Leverage service package and promo code performance data to inform marketing campaigns.
  - Use issue tracking and communication insights to enhance customer support and operational protocols.

- **Reporting and Visualization**
  - Develop dashboards summarizing key metrics: package performance, operator efficiency, payment behaviors, and customer issues.
  - Create alerts or reports for anomalies such as spikes in booking issues or operator cancellations.
  - Provide actionable insights and recommendations to QuickWash management for continuous improvement.
