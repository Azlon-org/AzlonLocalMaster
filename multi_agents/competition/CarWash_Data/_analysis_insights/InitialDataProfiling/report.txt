## QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS  

### Question 1  
What files did you process? Which files were generated? Answer with detailed file path.  
### Answer 1  
The phase processed the following files located in `multi_agents/competition/CarWash_Data`:  
- `orders.csv`  
- `operators.csv`  
- `customers.csv`  
- `services.csv`  

No explicit output files were generated during this phase. However, the code attempted to create a correlation heatmap image named `orders_numeric_correlation_heatmap.png` in the same directory if sufficient numeric data was available in `orders.csv`. The output does not confirm whether this file was ultimately created.

### Question 2  
Which features were involved in this phase? What changes did they undergo? If any feature types were modified, answer which features are modified and how they are modified. If any features were deleted or created, answer which features are deleted or created and provide detailed explanations.  
### Answer 2  
All features across the four datasets were involved in initial profiling, including:  
- Key ID fields such as `client_id`, `operator_id`, `order_id`  
- Booking details, service package tiers, pricing, cancellations, penalties, and operator settings  
- Customer financial data including payment methods and quick bucks credits  

No feature type conversions, deletions, or creations were performed during this phase. The work focused on assessing data quality through missing value detection, duplicate checks, and validity assessments (e.g., date parsing, outlier detection). No features were altered or engineered yet.

### Question 3  
Which key features (e.g., `client_id`, `operator_id`, `order_id`, booking details, payment info) were identified as having missing or unreliable values? How were these handled (e.g., dropped, imputed, flagged), and what are the estimated impacts of these decisions on data representativeness and bias?  
### Answer 3  
Missingness and unreliability in critical ID features such as `client_id`, `operator_id`, and `order_id` were flagged during profiling. However, no handling steps such as dropping or imputing were applied in this phase. The data cleaning impact and bias assessments were planned for subsequent phases. Currently, missing or unreliable data have been identified but remain untreated, with anticipated impacts on representativeness and bias to be explicitly quantified later.

### Question 4  
What patterns or insights emerged regarding operator compliance and performance metrics, including verification status, job completion rates, cancellations, and penalties? How might these insights guide the selection of features and hypotheses for iterative modeling?  
### Answer 4  
No concrete insights or pattern analyses related to operator compliance, verification status, job completions, cancellations, or penalties were produced in this phase. These analyses were part of the planned scope but deferred to future phases. The forthcoming analyses will guide feature selection and hypothesis formulation to link operator attributes with booking outcomes and incentive effectiveness.

### Question 5  
What customer segmentation approaches were explored using financial behavior and booking data? What challenges related to data uncertainty or missingness were encountered, and how could these be addressed in iterative analyses?  
### Answer 5  
Customer segmentation using financial behavior and booking data was not explored during this phase. The plan includes future segmentation based on quick bucks credit usage, payment methods, and retention risk. Challenges such as data uncertainty and missingness are anticipated and will be addressed with imputation-aware clustering and uncertainty quantification methods in iterative analyses.

### Question 6  
Which booking quality issues, compensation claims, and marketing effectiveness insights were identified? How can these findings prioritize operational interventions or feature engineering in the upcoming iterative analysis?  
### Answer 6  
No booking quality issues, compensation claims, or marketing effectiveness insights were identified or analyzed in this phase. These areas were earmarked for subsequent analysis to extract actionable insights that will inform operational priorities and targeted feature engineering in iterative modeling.

---

### Question 7  
What bias assessments, sensitivity analyses, or uncertainty quantification methods were implemented or planned? How will these be integrated into the iterative modeling process to ensure robust and trustworthy insights?  
### Answer 7  
No bias assessments, sensitivity analyses, or uncertainty quantification methods were implemented during this phase. However, the plan outlines explicit intentions to conduct these in subsequent phases. These methods will be integrated iteratively with stakeholder feedback to mitigate biases introduced by data cleaning decisions and to enhance model robustness and transparency throughout the modeling lifecycle.
