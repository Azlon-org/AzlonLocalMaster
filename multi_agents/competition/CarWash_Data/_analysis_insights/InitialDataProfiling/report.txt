## QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS  

### Question 1  
What files did you process? Which files were generated? Answer with detailed file path.

### Answer 1  
The processed files were all CSV files located in the directory `multi_agents/competition/CarWash_Data`. Specifically, the critical files identified and processed included:  
- `orders.csv`  
- `clients.csv`  
- `operators.csv`  

The code dynamically loaded all `.csv` files present in the directory for profiling and quality checks. No output or processed files were generated or saved during this phase.

### Question 2  
Which features were involved in this phase? What changes did they undergo? If any feature types were modified, answer which features are modified and how they are modified. If any features were deleted or created, answer which features are deleted or created and provide detailed explanations.

### Answer 2  
All features from the loaded datasets were involved in this phase. The phase focused on initial data loading and profiling without modifying, deleting, or creating any features. The activities performed on features included:  
- Checking for missing values and duplicates.  
- Detecting numeric outliers using the IQR method.  
- Identifying potential inconsistencies in categorical features such as inconsistent casing or leading/trailing whitespaces.  

No feature type conversions or transformations were applied at this stage.

### Question 3  
How complete and reliable are the linkage keys (e.g., user IDs, booking IDs, operator codes) necessary for cross-dataset joins? Are there any gaps or mismatches that could affect integrated analyses?

### Answer 3  
While no explicit detailed report on linkage keys was provided, the quality checks performed included assessments of missing values and duplicates that would impact linkage keys. No critical errors or warnings about such keys were reported, suggesting they are reasonably complete and reliable. However, further validation of linkage keys is recommended in subsequent phases to ensure integrity for cross-dataset joins. Potential gaps or mismatches remain possible but were not identified as critical at this stage.

### Question 4  
Which data quality issues or feature gaps identified in this phase should be prioritized for cleaning, validation, or enrichment in the IterativeAnalysisLoop? Are there any hypotheses or specific questions that arose from profiling to test next?

### Answer 4  
The following data quality issues were identified or implied and should be prioritized for cleaning and validation:  
- Missing values in some features requiring imputation or handling.  
- Duplicate rows that need removal or reconciliation.  
- Inconsistent formatting in categorical variables (e.g., varying cases, extraneous spaces) that require standardization.  
- Numeric outliers that need investigation to determine if they represent errors or valid extremes.  

Hypotheses and next steps include:  
- Assessing the impact of outliers on revenue and operator performance metrics.  
- Evaluating how missing values and duplicates affect linkage key reliability and overall data integrity.  
- Investigating if categorical inconsistencies skew analytical results, such as promo code usage or payment method distribution.  
- Exploring any systematic data gaps correlated with booking issues or service complaints.

### Question 5  
What initial insights emerged regarding customer behavior, service package popularity, operator performance, and payment methods from the profiling? Were there any unexpected patterns or anomalies?

### Answer 5  
No concrete business insights, anomalies, or patterns were identified or reported in this phase. The work focused primarily on data readiness through profiling and quality assurance rather than exploratory or domain-specific analysis. Subsequent phases are expected to generate detailed insights into these areas.

### Question 6  
Based on the profiling outcomes, what initial metrics, visualizations, or dashboards do you recommend developing to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) through the IterativeAnalysisLoop?

### Answer 6  
Recommended KPIs and dashboards for monitoring in the next phases include:  

- **Data Quality KPIs:**  
  - Rates of missing values per feature and dataset.  
  - Counts of duplicate records and deduplication progress.  
  - Outlier detection summaries for numeric features.  
  - Consistency checks for categorical variables.  

- **Customer Behavior Metrics:**  
  - Booking frequency segmented by customer groups.  
  - Promo code usage rates and their revenue impact.  
  - Payment method preferences (e.g., QuickBucks vs card).  
  - Customer retention and repeat booking rates.  

- **Service Package and Revenue Metrics:**  
  - Frequency and revenue contribution of each service package.  
  - Impact of extra services and bundle offerings on sales.  
  - Pricing distribution and average revenue per booking.  

- **Operator Performance Metrics:**  
  - Booking completion and cancellation rates per operator.  
  - Relationship between operator verification status and complaint rates.  
  - Operator compensation relative to job completion metrics.  

- **Operational Dashboards:**  
  - Counts and resolution times of booking issues.  
  - Communication volumes and responsiveness (chats, notifications).  
  - Operator scheduling efficiency compared to booking demand.  

Visualizations such as bar charts, heatmaps, time series plots, and scatter plots are recommended to effectively track these KPIs, with dashboard filters for time periods, operator segments, customer groups, and service packages.
