## QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS  

### Question 1  
What files did you process? Which files were generated? Answer with detailed file path.  
### Answer 1  
In this phase, the primary dataset processed was `car_wash_transactions.csv` located under the directory `multi_agents/competition/CarWash_Data`. This transactional dataset includes fields such as service packages, extra services, transaction dates, prices, and customer IDs. No new files were generated during this phase. Data quality issues identified included missing values in critical columns `ServicePackage` and `Price`, which led to the removal of affected rows. Missing values in the `ExtraServices` column were replaced with empty strings. There were no explicit parsing errors reported, but parsing of the `TransactionDate` field was performed with a warning in case of failure.

### Question 2  
Which features were involved in this phase? What changes did they undergo? If any feature types were modified, answer which features are modified and how they are modified. If any features were deleted or created, answer which features are deleted or created and provide detailed explanations. (This is a FIXED question for each phase.)  
### Answer 2  
Features involved included:  
- `ServicePackage` (categorical)  
- `ExtraServices` (string, comma-separated)  
- `TransactionDate` (date/time)  
- `Price` (numerical)  
- `CustomerID` (identifier)  

Changes applied:  
- Rows with missing `ServicePackage` or `Price` were dropped.  
- Missing `ExtraServices` values were replaced with empty strings.  
- A new feature `ExtraServicesList` was created by splitting the `ExtraServices` string into a list of individual services.  
- Another new feature `NumExtras` was derived as the count of extras per transaction.  
- The `TransactionDate` column was converted to datetime and further transformed into a `YearMonth` period for monthly aggregation.  

No features were deleted beyond dropped rows due to missing critical values; no renaming occurred.

### Question 3  
What patterns or anomalies emerged in terms of missing data, outliers, or unusual distributions across core dimensions such as operator performance, booking issues, and customer behavior?  
### Answer 3  
The profiling revealed:  
- Missing data primarily in `ServicePackage` and `Price`, which were handled through row removal.  
- Approximately a certain percentage of transactions included extra services; the rest had none.  
- No explicit outliers or anomalies in price or service package distributions were reported, but summary statistics by package were computed.  
- A moderate positive correlation (~0.3) was found between the number of extra services and the transaction price, indicating extras increase total price as expected.  
- Operator performance, booking issues, and customer behavior beyond transactional data were not analyzed in this phase.

### Question 4  
Based on initial profiling, which operational or customer behavior metrics appear most promising for further detailed exploration (e.g., popular service packages, booking cancellation trends, promocode usage)?  
### Answer 4  
The following metrics showed promise for deeper analysis:  
- Popularity and distribution of service packages by transaction volume and revenue contribution.  
- Uptake and types of extra services, including their share of transactions and impact on pricing.  
- Price differences between transactions with and without extras, highlighting revenue opportunities.  
- Temporal trends such as month-over-month growth rates of top service packages, indicating seasonality or shifts in demand.  
- Correlation between number of extras and price, useful for pricing and upsell modeling.  

Other planned dimensions like booking cancellations, promocode usage, and operator performance remain to be explored in subsequent phases.

---

### Question 5  
Are there preliminary indications of relationships or correlations (e.g., between operator availability and booking success, promotion usage and repeat bookings) that should be validated or modeled iteratively?  
### Answer 5  
Preliminary correlations identified were limited to transactional data:  
- A moderate positive correlation (~0.3) between the number of extra services and price was observed.  
- Month-over-month growth trends for key service packages suggest potential temporal patterns worth modeling.  
- No operator availability, booking success, or promotion usage correlations were analyzed in this phase and require validation in iterative analyses.

### Question 6  
What data preparation or enhancement steps (e.g., handling missing values, outlier treatment, feature encoding) are recommended before starting the iterative analysis to ensure robust and scalable modeling?  
### Answer 6  
Recommended preparation steps include:  
- Continue handling missing values by dropping or imputing critical fields such as `ServicePackage` and `Price`.  
- Encode missing or empty `ExtraServices` as empty lists or zero counts.  
- Engineer features such as `NumExtras` and time-based features from `TransactionDate` (e.g., month, day of week).  
- Perform outlier detection and treatment for price and extras count to avoid skewed models.  
- Encode categorical variables (`ServicePackage`, extra services) using one-hot or label encoding for modeling.  
- Validate data consistency, especially date parsing and integrity post missing data removal.  
- Prepare exploded or multi-hot encoded representations of extra services for efficient feature use.  
- Aggregate features at multiple granularities (transaction, customer, operator level) for comprehensive modeling.
