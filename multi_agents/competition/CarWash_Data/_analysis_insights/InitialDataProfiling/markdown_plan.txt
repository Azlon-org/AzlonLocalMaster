- **Data Quality and Integrity Assessment**  
  - Complete robust parsing and cleaning of corrupted files (`clients.csv`, `orders.csv`, `operators.csv`), including delimiter normalization and extraction of embedded JSON fields.  
  - Quantify missingness and malformed data in critical ID fields (`client_id`, `operator_id`, `order_id`) and evaluate the impact of dropping vs. imputing these records.  
  - Implement and document bias assessments and sensitivity analyses to understand data cleaning impacts on representativeness.

- **Operator Compliance and Performance Analysis**  
  - Analyze operator verification status and documentation completeness against booking outcomes, cancellation rates, and penalty applications.  
  - Evaluate operator availability, job completion counts, compensation patterns, and cancellation penalties to identify workforce utilization and incentive effectiveness.  
  - Investigate operator settings (e.g., max daily jobs, commission rates) and their correlation with performance and customer satisfaction.

- **Revenue and Service Usage Profiling**  
  - Examine booking frequency and revenue contribution by service package tier and extra service uptake.  
  - Analyze pricing anomalies, refund patterns, and their effects on overall profitability.  
  - Assess customer uptake of promotional codes linked to specific service packages.

- **Customer Financial Behavior and Segmentation**  
  - Integrate `quick_bucks` credit ledger data with booking histories to segment customers by spending behavior, credit usage, and retention risk.  
  - Parse and analyze payment card data for payment method preferences and fraud risk indicators.  
  - Develop customer segments considering data completeness and uncertainty, applying imputation-aware clustering or classification methods.

- **Booking Quality and Issue Resolution**  
  - Correlate booking issues and compensation claims with operator and customer attributes.  
  - Leverage pre-wash checklist data, including images and signatures, to evaluate quality assurance effectiveness and dispute mitigation.  
  - Identify operational bottlenecks and propose interventions to reduce booking-related issues.

- **Marketing Effectiveness and Communication Analysis**  
  - Assess promo code usage patterns and push notification campaign effectiveness across customer segments.  
  - Analyze chat logs and notification responses to measure support responsiveness and its impact on issue resolution and customer satisfaction.  
  - Identify customer segments most responsive to marketing efforts for targeted campaigns.

- **Advanced Analytical Modeling and Hypothesis Testing**  
  - Formulate and test hypotheses linking operator verification, penalties, and compensation to cancellations and booking outcomes.  
  - Develop predictive models for booking cancellations, operator no-shows, and customer churn incorporating data quality uncertainty.  
  - Use iterative validation loops with stakeholder feedback to refine models and incorporate bias mitigation strategies.

- **Bias Mitigation and Uncertainty Quantification**  
  - Explicitly quantify bias introduced by data cleaning decisions (e.g., dropping missing IDs, imputing 'Unknown' categories).  
  - Implement uncertainty quantification methods (e.g., multiple imputations, sensitivity analyses) to support robust segmentation and modeling.  
  - Transparently document data limitations, cleaning steps, and their impacts in all reporting and stakeholder communications.

- **Operational and Data Governance Recommendations**  
  - Conduct root cause analyses (e.g., data lineage audits) to identify sources of data corruption and missingness.  
  - Collaborate with data engineering to improve upstream data capture, validation, and ingestion processes.  
  - Establish automated data quality monitoring frameworks and maintain iterative validation loops to ensure ongoing data integrity and analytical reliability.

- **Stakeholder Engagement and Reporting**  
  - Develop interim visualizations and dashboards to communicate data quality status, cleaning impacts, and preliminary insights.  
  - Incorporate clear documentation of assumptions, biases, and uncertainty in all analytical outputs.  
  - Prioritize actionable insights with clear business implications to guide operational and strategic decision-making.
