Thank you for providing the INFO and PLAN. Based on the detailed plan for the FinalInsightCompilation phase and considering that there is no next phase (None), here are 6 key questions designed to:  
- Summarize the key findings of this final phase,  
- Reflect on the overall project outcomes, and  
- Provide guidance for any post-competition wrap-up, knowledge transfer, or future continuation efforts.
