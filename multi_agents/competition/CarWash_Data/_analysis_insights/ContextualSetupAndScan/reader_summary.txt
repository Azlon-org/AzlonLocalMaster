### Summary of Business Context
QuickWash is a platform (app and website) that connects car detailers ("operators") with customers who request car wash services. When a customer books a wash, a detailer travels to the customerâ€™s location and performs the service. The business likely focuses on convenience, quality of service, and possibly a range of service package options.
