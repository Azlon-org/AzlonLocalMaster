### Summary

**Business Context:**  
QuickWash operates a platform (app and website) that connects car detailers (“operators”) directly with customers. Customers request car wash services through the app, and detailers travel to the customer’s location to perform the wash. The business model revolves around on-demand mobile car washing and detailing services with various service packages and potential extras.
