        "Description": "The Titanic competition is a beginner-friendly machine learning challenge on Kaggle. The goal is to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using various features such as age, gender, and socio-economic class.",
        "Historical Context": "The Titanic sank on April 15, 1912, after hitting an iceberg, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew."

        "gender_submission.csv": "An example submission file assuming all female passengers survived."
    },
    "Question": "The main task is to build a predictive model to determine which passengers were more likely to survive the Titanic disaster.",
    "Target_Variable": "Survived (1 for survived, 0 for deceased)",

        "Metric": "Accuracy (percentage of correctly predicted survival outcomes)"
