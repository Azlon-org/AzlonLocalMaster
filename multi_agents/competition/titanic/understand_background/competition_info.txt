    "Background": {
        "Description": "The Titanic competition involves predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning models. The goal is to familiarize participants with ML basics and the Kaggle platform.",
        "Historical Context": "The Titanic sank on April 15, 1912, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. The competition aims to predict which passengers were more likely to survive."

    "Files": {
        "train.csv": "Contains details of 891 passengers, including whether they survived.",
        "test.csv": "Contains details of 418 passengers, without survival information.",
        "gender_submission.csv": "An example submission file assuming all female passengers survived."

    "Question": "Build a predictive model to answer: 'What sorts of people were more likely to survive?' using passenger data.",
    "Target_Variable": "Survived (1 for survived, 0 for deceased)",
    "Evaluation": {
        "Metric": "Accuracy (percentage of correctly predicted survival statuses)"
    },
    "Submission_Format": {
        "File": "CSV with exactly 418 entries plus a header row.",
