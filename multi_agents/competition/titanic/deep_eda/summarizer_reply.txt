## 4. Reviewer's Evaluations and Suggestions for the Agents
### Agent Planner
#### Score: 5
#### Evaluation:
- **Strengths**: The plan is comprehensive, well-structured, and covers all essential aspects of in-depth exploratory data analysis. The tasks and methods are clearly defined, and the expected outcomes are well-articulated.
- **Areas for Improvement**: No specific suggestions for improvement are necessary.

### Agent Developer
#### Score: 4
#### Evaluation:
- **Strengths**: The implementation is thorough and follows the plan closely. The code is well-structured, well-documented, and effectively handles the tasks outlined in the plan.
- **Areas for Improvement**: While the agent has done an excellent job in implementing the tasks and correcting the issue with non-numeric columns, there is room for improvement in terms of initial error handling. The agent could have included checks or preprocessing steps to ensure that only numeric columns are used from the beginning, which would prevent such errors from occurring.
