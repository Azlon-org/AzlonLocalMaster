Current Step Being Performed\nThe current step being performed is Data Cleaning for the Titanic data science competition.\n\n## 2. Plan Designed by the Planner to Complete This Step\n### Objectives:\n1. Identify and handle missing values.\n2. Handle incorrect or inconsistent data.\n3. Convert data types.\n4. Standardize categorical variables.\n5. Remove duplicates.\n6. Detect and handle outliers.\n7. Save the cleaned data.\n\n### Tasks and Methods:\n1. **Identify and Handle Missing Values**\n   - **Method**: Check for missing values in each column using methods like `isnull()` and `sum()`. Decide on a strategy for each column with missing values: drop, fill with mean/median/mode, or use more advanced imputation techniques. Implement the chosen strategy using pandas functions like `dropna()`, `fillna()`, or `SimpleImputer` from sklearn.\n2. **Handle Incorrect or Inconsistent Data**\n   - **Method**: Identify any incorrect or inconsistent data entries (e.g., negative ages, invalid ticket numbers). Correct or remove these entries as appropriate.\n3. **Convert Data Types**\n   - **Method**: Ensure all columns have appropriate data types (e.g., convert numerical columns to `int` or `float`, categorical columns to `category`). Use pandas functions like `astype()` to convert data types.\n4. **Standardize Categorical Variables**\n   - **Method**: Ensure consistency in categorical variables (e.g., standardize the values in the 'embarked' column to 'C', 'Q', 'S'). Use string manipulation functions in pandas to clean and standardize these values.\n5. **Remove Duplicates**\n   - **Method**: Check for duplicate rows using `duplicated()`. Remove duplicates using `drop_duplicates()`.\n6. **Outlier Detection and Handling**\n   - **Method**: Identify outliers in numerical columns using statistical methods (e.g., IQR, Z-score). Decide on a strategy to handle outliers: remove, cap, or transform. Implement the chosen strategy using pandas or numpy functions.\n7. **Save the Cleaned Data**\n   - **Method**: Save the cleaned dataset to a new CSV file using `to_csv()` for future use in the next steps.\n\n## 3. Detailed Account of How the Developer Implemented the Plan\n### Task 1: Identify and Handle Missing Values\n#### Method:\n- Checked for missing values in each column.\n- Used the median to fill missing values in 'Age' and 'Fare' columns.\n- Used the mode to fill missing values in the 'Embarked' column.\n- Dropped the 'Cabin' column due to too many missing values.\n#### Code:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer\n\n# Load the datasets\ntrain_data_path = '/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/titanic/train.csv'\ntest_data_path = '/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/titanic/test.csv'\n\ntrain_df = pd.read_csv(train_data_path)\ntest_df = pd.read_csv(test_data_path)\n\n# Copy the DataFrames before processing\ntrain_df_clean = train_df.copy()\ntest_df_clean = test_df.copy()\n\n# Identify missing values\nmissing_train = train_df_clean.isnull().sum()\nmissing_test = test_df_clean.isnull().sum()\n\nprint(\"Missing Values in Training Data:\")\nprint(missing_train)\n\nprint(\"\\nMissing Values in Test Data:\")\nprint(missing_test)\n\n# Handle missing values\n# For 'Age', 'Fare' columns, we will use the median to fill missing values\nimputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='median')\ntrain_df_clean['Age'] = imputer.fit_transform(train_df_clean[['Age']])\ntest_df_clean['Age'] = imputer.transform(test_df_clean[['Age']])\ntrain_df_clean['Fare'] = imputer.fit_transform(train_df_clean[['Fare']])\ntest_df_clean['Fare'] = imputer.transform(test_df_clean[['Fare']])\n\n# For 'Embarked' column, we will use the mode to fill missing values\nimputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='most_frequent')\ntrain_df_clean['Embarked'] = imputer.fit_transform(train_df_clean[['Embarked']])\ntest_df_clean['Embarked'] = imputer.transform(test_df_clean[['Embarked']])\n\n# Drop 'Cabin' column due to too many missing values\ntrain_df_clean.drop(columns=['Cabin'], inplace=True)\ntest_df_clean.drop(columns=['Cabin'], inplace=True)\n\n# Verify that there are no more missing values\nassert train_df_clean.isnull().sum().sum() == 0, \"There are still missing values in the training data.\"\nassert test_df_clean.isnull().sum().sum() == 0, \"There are still missing values in the test data.\"\n\nprint(\"Missing values handled successfully.\")\n```\n#### Explanation:\n- Loaded the datasets and created copies for processing.\n- Identified missing values and handled them using median and mode imputation.\n- Dropped the 'Cabin' column due to excessive missing values.\n- Verified that there are no remaining missing values.\n\n### Task 2: Handle Incorrect or Inconsistent Data\n#### Method:\n- Checked for negative ages and invalid ticket numbers.\n#### Code:\n```python\n# Handle incorrect or inconsistent data\n# Check for negative ages\nassert (train_df_clean['Age'] >= 0).all(), \"There are negative ages in the training data.\"\nassert (test_df_clean['Age'] >= 0).all(), \"There are negative ages in the test data.\"\n\n# Check for invalid ticket numbers (e.g., empty strings)\nassert train_df_clean['Ticket'].str.strip().astype(bool).all(), \"There are invalid ticket numbers in the training data.\"\nassert test_df_clean['Ticket'].str.strip().astype(bool).all(), \"There are invalid ticket numbers in the test data.\"\n\nprint(\"No incorrect or inconsistent data found.\")\n```\n#### Explanation:\n- Ensured there are no negative ages or invalid ticket numbers in the datasets.\n\n### Task 3: Convert Data Types\n#### Method:\n- Converted relevant columns to appropriate data types.\n#### Code:\n```python\n# Convert data types\n# Convert 'Pclass', 'SibSp', 'Parch' to categorical\ncategorical_columns = ['Pclass', 'SibSp', 'Parch', 'Embarked', 'Sex']\nfor col in categorical_columns:\n    train_df_clean[col] = train_df_clean[col].astype('category')\n    test_df_clean[col] = test_df_clean[col].astype('category')\n\n# Ensure numerical columns are of correct type\nnumerical_columns = ['Age', 'Fare']\nfor col in numerical_columns:\n    train_df_clean[col] = train_df_clean[col].astype('float')\n    test_df_clean[col] = test_df_clean[col].astype('float')\n\n# Verify data types\nfor col in categorical_columns:\n    assert train_df_clean[col].dtype == 'category', f\"Column {col} is not of type 'category' in the training data.\"\n    assert test_df_clean[col].dtype == 'category', f\"Column {col} is not of type 'category' in the test data.\"\nfor col in numerical_columns:\n    assert train_df_clean[col].dtype == 'float64', f\"Column {col} is not of type 'float' in the training data.\"\n    assert test_df_clean[col].dtype == 'float64', f\"Column {col} is not of type 'float' in the test data.\"\n\nprint(\"Data types converted successfully.\")\n```\n#### Explanation:\n- Converted categorical columns to `category` type and numerical columns to `float`.\n- Verified the data types to ensure correctness.\n\n### Task 4: Standardize Categorical Variables\n#### Method:\n- Standardized the values in the 'Embarked' column.\n#### Code:\n```python\n# Standardize categorical variables\n# Ensure consistency in 'Embarked' column\ntrain_df_clean['Embarked'] = train_df_clean['Embarked'].str.strip().str.upper()\ntest_df_clean['Embarked'] = test_df_clean['Embarked'].str.strip().str.upper()\n\n# Verify standardization\nassert train_df_clean['Embarked'].isin(['C', 'Q', 'S']).all(), \"There are inconsistent values in the 'Embarked' column in the training data.\"\nassert test_df_clean['Embarked'].isin(['C', 'Q', 'S']).all(), \"There are inconsistent values in the 'Embarked' column in the test data.\"\n\nprint(\"Categorical variables standardized successfully.\")\n```\n#### Explanation:\n- Ensured consistency in the 'Embarked' column values.\n\n### Task 5: Remove Duplicates\n#### Method:\n- Checked for and removed duplicate rows.\n#### Code:\n```python\n# Remove duplicates\ntrain_df_clean.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)\ntest_df_clean.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)\n\n# Verify no duplicates\nassert not train_df_clean.duplicated().any(), \"There are duplicate rows in the training data.\"\nassert not test_df_clean.duplicated().any(), \"There are duplicate rows in the test data.\"\n\nprint(\"Duplicates removed successfully.\")\n```\n#### Explanation:\n- Removed duplicate rows and verified their absence.\n\n### Task 6: Outlier Detection and Handling\n#### Method:\n- Identified and handled outliers using the IQR method.\n#### Code:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Identify and handle outliers using IQR\ndef handle_outliers(df, column):\n    Q1 = df[column].quantile(0.25)\n    Q3 = df[column].quantile(0.75)\n    IQR = Q3 - Q1\n    lower_bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR\n    upper_bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR\n    df[column] = np.where(df[column] < lower_bound, lower_bound, df[column])\n    df[column] = np.where(df[column] > upper_bound, upper_bound, df[column])\n\n# Handle outliers in 'Age' and 'Fare' columns\nhandle_outliers(train_df_clean, 'Age')\nhandle_outliers(train_df_clean, 'Fare')\nhandle_outliers(test_df_clean, 'Age')\nhandle_outliers(test_df_clean, 'Fare')\n\nprint(\"Outliers handled successfully.\")\n```\n#### Explanation:\n- Identified outliers using the IQR method and capped them to the lower and upper bounds.\n\n### Task 7: Save the Cleaned Data\n#### Method:\n- Saved the cleaned datasets to new CSV files.\n#### Code:\n```python\n# Save the cleaned data\ntrain_df_clean.to_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/titanic/cleaned_train.csv', index=False)\ntest_df_clean.to_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/titanic/cleaned_test.csv', index=False)\n\nprint(\"Cleaned data saved successfully.\")\n```\n#### Explanation:\n- Saved the cleaned datasets for future use.\n\n## 4.

Note you are in step: In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis.\n## RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS ##\n- Always consider the runtime and efficiency of your code when writing code, especially for data visualization, handling large datasets, or complex algorithms.\n<example>\nData visualization: When using libraries such as seaborn or matplotlib to create plots, consider turning off unnecessary details (e.g., annot=False in heatmaps), especially when the number of data points is large.\n</example>\n- Always consider resource constraints and limit the number of generated images to ensure that they do not exceed 10 when performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), \n    - **Note that the generated images should be LIMITED to the most critical visualizations that provide valuable insights.**\n<example>   \nWhen using the matplotlib library for visualizing multiple subplots, if you need to display relationships between multiple variables, you can set up subplots within a single figure window instead of generating separate plots for each variable relationship. This approach not only makes effective use of visual space but also adheres to the rule of limiting the number of generated plots. For example, if there are 12 variable combinations, you can choose the most critical 10 combinations to display.\n</example>\n## CODING RULES ##\n- Always use `print()` function if you need to print a value. \n- Always use `plt.close()` to close the figure after saving the image.\n- Always make sure that the data types of each column in the dataset are correct before performing any data computation, analysis, or other operations.\n<example>\n- Before calculating a correlation matrix, confirm that the dataset only contains numerical data. If there is non-numerical data, handle it appropriately, such as by removing or converting it to numerical data.\n- Before performing data merging or joining operations, ensure that the data types of all relevant columns are consistent to avoid errors caused by type mismatches.\n</example>\n- At each critical step of writing code, always reasonable `assert` statements to verify the correctness of the code segments and the successful execution of step In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis.\n<example>\nAfter data cleaning, you can use assert statements to check whether the cleaned dataset is empty or if the data types of specific columns meet expectations.\n</example>\n- Always ensure that the same modifications, such as feature scaling, missing value handling, and categorical variable encoding, are applied to both the training set and the test set when handling datasets. \n    - Note that the test dataset typically does not include the target variable, so special care must be taken when applying target encoding or feature engineering that depends on the target variable.\n- Always copy the DataFrame before processing it and use the copy to process.\n\n#############\n# TASK #\n\nDevelop a solution based on the plan provided by the Planner.

Note you are in step: In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis.\\n## RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS ##\\n- Always consider the runtime and efficiency of your code when writing code, especially for data visualization, handling large datasets, or complex algorithms.\\n<example>\\nData visualization: When using libraries such as seaborn or matplotlib to create plots, consider turning off unnecessary details (e.g., annot=False in heatmaps), especially when the number of data points is large.\\n</example>\\n- Always consider resource constraints and limit the number of generated images to ensure that they do not exceed 10 when performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), \\n    - **Note that the generated images should be LIMITED to the most critical visualizations that provide valuable insights.**\\n<example>   \\nWhen using the matplotlib library for visualizing multiple subplots, if you need to display relationships between multiple variables, you can set up subplots within a single figure window instead of generating separate plots for each variable relationship. This approach not only makes effective use of visual space but also adheres to the rule of limiting the number of generated plots. For example, if there are 12 variable combinations, you can choose the most critical 10 combinations to display.\\n</example>\\n## CODING RULES ##\\n- Always use `print()` function if you need to print a value. \\n- Always use `plt.close()` to close the figure after saving the image.\\n- Always make sure that the data types of each column in the dataset are correct before performing any data computation, analysis, or other operations.\\n<example>\\n- Before calculating a correlation matrix, confirm that the dataset only contains numerical data. If there is non-numerical data, handle it appropriately, such as by removing or converting it to numerical data.\\n- Before performing data merging or joining operations, ensure that the data types of all relevant columns are consistent to avoid errors caused by type mismatches.\\n</example>\\n- At each critical step of writing code, always reasonable `assert` statements to verify the correctness of the code segments and the successful execution of step In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis.\\n<example>\\nAfter data cleaning, you can use assert statements to check whether the cleaned dataset is empty or if the data types of specific columns meet expectations.\\n</example>\\n- Always ensure that the same modifications, such as feature scaling, missing value handling, and categorical variable encoding, are applied to both the training set and the test set when handling datasets. \\n    - Note that the test dataset typically does not include the target variable, so special care must be taken when applying target encoding or feature engineering that depends on the target variable.\\n- Always copy the DataFrame before processing it and use the copy to process.\\n\\n#############\\n# TASK #\\n\\nDevelop a solution based on the plan provided by the Planner.
