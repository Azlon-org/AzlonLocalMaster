Great! Now that I have the code and insights from the previous steps, as well as the features and sample data from both the training and test datasets, I can proceed with the In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (In-depth EDA).

### TASK 1: THOUGHT PROCESS
For the In-depth EDA, we will focus on the following:
1. **Detailed Visualizations**: Create visualizations to understand the relationships between different features and the target variable (`Survived`).
2. **Statistical Analyses**: Perform statistical tests to uncover deeper insights into the data.
3. **Correlation Analysis**: Analyze the correlation between features and the target variable.
4. **Feature Interactions**: Explore interactions between different features.

### TASK 1: CODE
Let's start by loading the cleaned data and performing detailed visualizations and statistical analyses.

```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import scipy.stats as stats

# Load the cleaned datasets
train_data_path = '/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/titanic/cleaned_train.csv'
test_data_path = '/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/titanic/cleaned_test.csv'

train_df = pd.read_csv(train_data_path)
test_df = pd.read_csv(test_data_path)

# Display the first few rows of the cleaned training data
print("Cleaned Training Data:")
print(train_df.head())

# Display the first few rows of the cleaned test data
print("\nCleaned Test Data:")
print(test_df.head())

# Ensure data types are correct
assert train_df['Pclass'].dtype == 'int64', "Pclass should be of type int64"
assert train_df['Survived'].dtype == 'int64', "Survived should be of type int64"
assert train_df['Age'].dtype == 'float64', "Age should be of type float64"
assert train_df['Fare'].dtype == 'float64', "Fare should be of type float64"

# Visualize the relationship between 'Pclass' and 'Survived'
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.countplot(x='Pclass', hue='Survived', data=train_df)
plt.title('Survival Count by Pclass')
plt.xlabel('Pclass')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.savefig('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/titanic/deep_eda/images/survival_by_pclass.png')
plt.close()

# Visualize the relationship between 'Sex' and 'Survived'
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.countplot(x='Sex', hue='Survived', data=train_df)
plt.title('Survival Count by Sex')
plt.xlabel('Sex')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.savefig('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/titanic/deep_eda/images/survival_by_sex.png')
plt.close()

# Visualize the relationship between 'Age' and 'Survived'
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.histplot(data=train_df, x='Age', hue='Survived', multiple='stack', kde=True)
plt.title('Survival Distribution by Age')
plt.xlabel('Age')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.savefig('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/titanic/deep_eda/images/survival_by_age.png')
plt.close()

# Visualize the relationship between 'Fare' and 'Survived'
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.histplot(data=train_df, x='Fare', hue='Survived', multiple='stack', kde=True)
plt.title('Survival Distribution by Fare')
plt.xlabel('Fare')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.savefig('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/titanic/deep_eda/images/survival_by_fare.png')
plt.close()

# Visualize the relationship between 'Embarked' and 'Survived'
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.countplot(x='Embarked', hue='Survived', data=train_df)
plt.title('Survival Count by Embarked')
plt.xlabel('Embarked')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.savefig('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/titanic/deep_eda/images/survival_by_embarked.png')
plt.close()

# Perform statistical tests
# Chi-square test for categorical variables
def chi_square_test(feature):
    contingency_table = pd.crosstab(train_df[feature], train_df['Survived'])
    chi2, p, dof, expected = stats.chi2_contingency(contingency_table)
    return p

categorical_features = ['Pclass', 'Sex', 'SibSp', 'Parch', 'Embarked']
for feature in categorical_features:
    p_value = chi_square_test(feature)
    print(f"Chi-square test p-value for {feature}: {p_value}")

# T-test for numerical variables
def t_test(feature):
    survived = train_df[train_df['Survived'] == 1][feature]
    not_survived = train_df[train_df['Survived'] == 0][feature]
    t_stat, p = stats.ttest_ind(survived, not_survived, nan_policy='omit')
    return p

numerical_features = ['Age', 'Fare']
for feature in numerical_features:
    p_value = t_test(feature)
    print(f"T-test p-value for {feature}: {p_value}")

# Correlation analysis
correlation_matrix = train_df.corr()
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', fmt='.2f')
plt.title('Correlation Matrix')
plt.savefig('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/titanic/deep_eda/images/correlation_matrix.png')
plt.close()
```

### TASK 1: EXPLANATION

   - **Survival by Pclass**: Visualizes the survival count by passenger class.
   - **Survival by Sex**: Visualizes the survival count by sex.
   - **Survival by Age**: Visualizes the survival distribution by age.
   - **Survival by Fare**: Visualizes the survival distribution by fare.
   - **Survival by Embarked**: Visualizes the survival count by port of embarkation.
4. **Statistical Tests**:
   - **Chi-square Test**: Tests the independence of categorical features with the target variable.
   - **T-test**: Tests the difference in means for numerical features between survived and not survived groups.
5. **Correlation Analysis**: Analyzes the correlation between features and visualizes the correlation matrix.

### TASK 2: THOUGHT PROCESS
Next, we will explore feature interactions and their impact on survival. This will involve visualizing interactions between pairs of features and the target variable.

### TASK 2: CODE
Let's proceed with visualizing feature interactions.

```python
# Visualize interaction between 'Pclass' and 'Sex' on 'Survived'
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.catplot(x='Pclass', hue='Sex', col='Survived', data=train_df, kind='count', height=5, aspect=1)
plt.savefig('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/titanic/deep_eda/images/pclass_sex_survived.png')
plt.close()

# Visualize interaction between 'Pclass' and 'Embarked' on 'Survived'
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.catplot(x='Pclass', hue='Embarked', col='Survived', data=train_df, kind='count', height=5, aspect=1)
plt.savefig('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/titanic/deep_eda/images/pclass_embarked_survived.png')
plt.close()

# Visualize interaction between 'Sex' and 'Embarked' on 'Survived'
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.catplot(x='Sex', hue='Embarked', col='Survived', data=train_df, kind='count', height=5, aspect=1)
plt.savefig('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/titanic/deep_eda/images/sex_embarked_survived.png')
plt.close()

# Visualize interaction between 'SibSp' and 'Parch' on 'Survived'
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.catplot(x='SibSp', hue='Parch', col='Survived', data=train_df, kind='count', height=5, aspect=1)
plt.savefig('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/titanic/deep_eda/images/sibsp_parch_survived.png')
plt.close()
```

### TASK 2: EXPLANATION
1. **Feature Interactions**:
   - **Pclass and Sex**: Visualizes the interaction between passenger class and sex on survival.
   - **Pclass and Embarked**: Visualizes the interaction between passenger class and port of embarkation on survival.
   - **Sex and Embarked**: Visualizes the interaction between sex and port of embarkation on survival.
   - **SibSp and Parch**: Visualizes the interaction between the number of siblings/spouses and parents/children on survival.

By following these steps, we will gain deeper insights into the data, which will be valuable for the subsequent feature engineering and model building steps.
