    "Competition Overview": {
        "Description": "The Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster competition is a beginner-friendly challenge on Kaggle where participants build a predictive model to determine which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck using passenger data.",
        "Goal": "Predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not using machine learning models."

            "Purpose": "Contains details of 418 passengers without survival information. Used for testing the model.",
