Great! Now that I have the necessary information, let's proceed with the tasks outlined in the plan for Model Building, Validation, and Prediction.

### TASK 1: Model Building

#### THOUGHT PROCESS
1. **Model Selection**: We will select a variety of machine learning models to test, including:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Trees
   - Random Forest
   - Gradient Boosting
   - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
2. **Data Preparation**: Use the processed data with the newly created features (FamilySize, IsAlone, Title, Age*Class, FarePerPerson) and the transformed categorical variables.
3. **Implementation**: Implement each model and ensure the code is well-documented with comments explaining the purpose of each code block.

#### CODE

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load the processed datasets
train_data_path = '/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/titanic/processed_train.csv'
test_data_path = '/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/titanic/processed_test.csv'

train_df = pd.read_csv(train_data_path)
test_df = pd.read_csv(test_data_path)

# Split the training data into features and target variable
X = train_df.drop(columns=['PassengerId', 'Survived', 'Name', 'Ticket'])
y = train_df['Survived']

# Split the data into training and validation sets
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize the models
models = {
    'Logistic Regression': LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000),
    'Decision Tree': DecisionTreeClassifier(),
    'Random Forest': RandomForestClassifier(),
    'Gradient Boosting': GradientBoostingClassifier(),
    'Support Vector Machine': SVC(),
    'K-Nearest Neighbors': KNeighborsClassifier()
}

# Train and evaluate each model
model_performance = {}

for model_name, model in models.items():
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    y_pred = model.predict(X_val)
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_val, y_pred)
    model_performance[model_name] = accuracy
    print(f"{model_name} Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")

# Save the model performance results
performance_df = pd.DataFrame(list(model_performance.items()), columns=['Model', 'Accuracy'])
performance_df.to_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/titanic/model_build_predict/model_performance.csv', index=False)
```

#### EXPLANATION

5. **Save Results**: Save the model performance results to a CSV file.

### TASK 2: Model Validation

#### THOUGHT PROCESS
1. **Cross-Validation**: Use k-fold cross-validation to ensure robust evaluation of the models.
2. **Evaluation Metrics**: Evaluate the performance of each model using accuracy as the primary metric, but also consider other metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score for a more comprehensive evaluation.

#### CODE

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
from sklearn.metrics import precision_score, recall_score, f1_score

# Initialize the models
models = {

    'Decision Tree': DecisionTreeClassifier(),
    'Random Forest': RandomForestClassifier(),
    'Gradient Boosting': GradientBoostingClassifier(),
    'Support Vector Machine': SVC(),
    'K-Nearest Neighbors': KNeighborsClassifier()
}

model_performance_cv = {}

for model_name, model in models.items():
    cv_scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5, scoring='accuracy')
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    y_pred = model.predict(X_val)
    precision = precision_score(y_val, y_pred)
    recall = recall_score(y_val, y_pred)
    f1 = f1_score(y_val, y_pred)
    model_performance_cv[model_name] = {
        'CV Accuracy': cv_scores.mean(),
        'Precision': precision,
        'Recall': recall,
        'F1 Score': f1
    }
    print(f"{model_name} - CV Accuracy: {cv_scores.mean():.4f}, Precision: {precision:.4f}, Recall: {recall:.4f}, F1 Score: {f1:.4f}")

# Save the cross-validation performance results
performance_cv_df = pd.DataFrame(model_performance_cv).T
performance_cv_df.to_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/titanic/model_build_predict/model_performance_cv.csv')
```

#### EXPLANATION
1. **Cross-Validation**: Perform 5-fold cross-validation for each model to ensure robust evaluation.
2. **Evaluation Metrics**: Calculate precision, recall, and F1-score for each model on the validation set.
3. **Save Results**: Save the cross-validation performance results to a CSV file.

### TASK 3: Hyperparameter Tuning

#### THOUGHT PROCESS
1. **Grid Search**: Perform hyperparameter tuning using grid search to find the best parameters for each model.
2. **Documentation**: Document the hyperparameter tuning process and the results obtained for each model.

#### CODE

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

# Define hyperparameter grids for each model
param_grids = {
    'Logistic Regression': {'C': [0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100]},
    'Decision Tree': {'max_depth': [None, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50]},

}

# Perform grid search for each model
best_params = {}

for model_name, param_grid in param_grids.items():
    model = models[model_name]
    grid_search = GridSearchCV(model, param_grid, cv=5, scoring='accuracy')
    grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)
    best_params[model_name] = grid_search.best_params_
    print(f"{model_name} Best Params: {grid_search.best_params_}")

# Save the best parameters
best_params_df = pd.DataFrame(best_params)

# Select the best model based on F1 Score
best_model_name = performance_cv_df.loc[performance_cv_df['F1 Score'].idxmax(), 'Model']
best_model = models[best_model_name]

# Train the best model on the entire training data
best_model.fit(X, y)

print(f"Selected Best Model: {best_model_name}")

2. **Submission Format**: Ensure the predictions are in the required submission format (CSV file with columns: PassengerId, Survived).

#### CODE

```python
# Prepare the test data for prediction
X_test = test_df.drop(columns=['PassengerId', 'Name', 'Ticket'])

# Make predictions on the test data
test_predictions = best_model.predict(X_test)

# Prepare the submission file
submission_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'PassengerId': test_df['PassengerId'],
    'Survived': test_predictions
})

# Save the submission file
submission_df.to_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/titanic/submission.csv', index=False)

print("Submission file created successfully.")
```

#### THOUGHT PROCESS
1. **Submit Predictions**: Submit the predictions to the competition platform (Kaggle) and monitor the leaderboard for feedback.

#### CODE

```python
# Note: The actual submission process is done on the Kaggle platform.
# Ensure the submission file is in the correct format and submit it on Kaggle.

print("Submit the 'submission.csv' file on the Kaggle competition platform.")
```

#### EXPLANATION
1. **Submit Predictions**: Submit the 'submission.csv' file on the Kaggle competition platform and monitor the leaderboard for feedback.

This completes the implementation of the tasks for Model Building, Validation, and Prediction. Ensure that the code is well-documented and includes comments explaining the purpose of each code block.
