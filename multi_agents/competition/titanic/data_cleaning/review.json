        "agent planner": "The plan is comprehensive and covers all essential aspects of data cleaning. However, it could benefit from a more detailed explanation of advanced imputation techniques and specific examples of handling incorrect or inconsistent data. Additionally, consider including a step for verifying the integrity of the cleaned data before saving it.",
        "agent developer": "The implementation is thorough and follows the plan closely. However, consider adding more comments to explain the purpose of each code block for better readability. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include error handling for file operations and data type conversions to make the code more robust."
