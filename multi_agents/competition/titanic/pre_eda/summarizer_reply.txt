## 3. Detailed Account of How the Developer Implemented the Plan
### Task 1: Load and Inspect Data
#### Method:
- Used pandas to read CSV files and display the first few rows.
#### Code:
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the datasets
train_data_path = '/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/titanic/train.csv'
test_data_path = '/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/titanic/test.csv'

train_df = pd.read_csv(train_data_path)
test_df = pd.read_csv(test_data_path)

# Display the first few rows of the training data
print("Training Data:")
print(train_df.head())

# Display the first few rows of the test data
print("\nTest Data:")
print(test_df.head())
```
#### Explanation:
- Loaded the datasets into pandas DataFrames.
- Displayed the first few rows of both datasets to get an initial understanding of the data.

### Task 2: Understand Data Structure
#### Method:
- Used pandas functions to get information about the data types, number of rows and columns, and summary statistics.
#### Code:
```python
# Get information about the training data
print("Training Data Info:")
print(train_df.info())

# Get summary statistics of the training data
print("\nTraining Data Summary Statistics:")
print(train_df.describe(include='all'))

# Get information about the test data
print("\nTest Data Info:")
print(test_df.info())

# Get summary statistics of the test data
print("\nTest Data Summary Statistics:")
print(test_df.describe(include='all'))
```
#### Explanation:
- Used the `info()` method to get information about the data types and the number of non-null values in each column.
- Used the `describe()` method to get summary statistics of the data, including count, mean, standard deviation, min, max, and quartiles.

### Task 3: Check for Missing Values
#### Method:
- Used pandas to check for null values and calculate the percentage of missing values for each column.
#### Code:
```python
# Check for missing values in the training data
missing_train = train_df.isnull().sum()
missing_train_percentage = (missing_train / len(train_df)) * 100

print("Missing Values in Training Data:")
print(missing_train_percentage)

# Check for missing values in the test data
missing_test = test_df.isnull().sum()
missing_test_percentage = (missing_test / len(test_df)) * 100

print("\nMissing Values in Test Data:")
print(missing_test_percentage)
```
#### Explanation:
- Counted the number of missing values in each column.
- Calculated the percentage of missing values by dividing the count of missing values by the total number of rows and multiplying by 100.

### Task 4: Analyze Target Variable (Survived)
#### Method:
- Used pandas and seaborn to plot the distribution of the 'Survived' column.
#### Code:
```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot the distribution of the 'Survived' column
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.countplot(x='Survived', data=train_df)
plt.title('Distribution of Survived')
plt.xlabel('Survived')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.savefig('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/titanic/pre_eda/images/distribution_of_survived.png')
plt.close()
```
#### Explanation:
- Created a count plot to visualize the distribution of the 'Survived' column.
- Saved the plot to the specified directory and closed the figure.

### Task 5: Explore Categorical Features
#### Method:
- Used pandas and seaborn to plot the distribution of categorical features.
#### Code:
```python
# List of categorical features
categorical_features = ['Pclass', 'Sex', 'SibSp', 'Parch', 'Embarked']

# Plot the distribution of each categorical feature
for feature in categorical_features:
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
    sns.countplot(x=feature, data=train_df)
    plt.title(f'Distribution of {feature}')
    plt.xlabel(feature)
    plt.ylabel('Count')
    plt.savefig(f'/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/titanic/pre_eda/images/distribution_of_{feature}.png')
    plt.close()
```
#### Explanation:
- Created count plots for each categorical feature to visualize their distributions.
- Saved each plot to the specified directory and closed the figure.

### Task 6: Explore Numerical Features
#### Method:
- Used pandas and seaborn to plot histograms and boxplots for numerical features.
#### Code:
```python
# List of numerical features
numerical_features = ['Age', 'Fare']

# Plot histograms and boxplots for each numerical feature
for feature in numerical_features:
    plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
    
    # Histogram
    plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
    sns.histplot(train_df[feature].dropna(), kde=True)
    plt.title(f'Histogram of {feature}')
    plt.xlabel(feature)
    plt.ylabel('Frequency')
    
    # Boxplot
    plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
    sns.boxplot(x=train_df[feature].dropna())
    plt.title(f'Boxplot of {feature}')
    plt.xlabel(feature)
    
    plt.savefig(f'/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/titanic/pre_eda/images/{feature}_distribution.png')
    plt.close()
```
#### Explanation:
- Created histograms and boxplots for each numerical feature to visualize their distributions and identify potential outliers.
- Saved each plot to the specified directory and closed the figure.

### Task 7: Identify Potential Outliers
#### Method:
- Used boxplots and scatter plots to identify outliers.
#### Code:
```python
# Identify potential outliers using boxplots
for feature in numerical_features:
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
    sns.boxplot(x=train_df[feature].dropna())
    plt.title(f'Boxplot of {feature}')
    plt.xlabel(feature)
    plt.savefig(f'/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/titanic/pre_eda/images/{feature}_outliers.png')
    plt.close()
```
#### Explanation:
- Created boxplots for each numerical feature to identify potential outliers.
- Saved each plot to the specified directory and closed the figure.

### Task 8: Initial Correlation Analysis
#### Method:
- Used pandas to calculate the correlation matrix and seaborn to visualize it.
#### Code:
```python
# Calculate the correlation matrix
numeric_columns = train_df.select_dtypes(include=['float64', 'int64']).columns
correlation_matrix = train_df[numeric_columns].corr()

# Plot the heatmap of the correlation matrix
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', fmt='.2f')
plt.title('Correlation Matrix')
plt.savefig('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/titanic/pre_eda/images/correlation_matrix.png')
plt.close()
```
#### Explanation:
- Calculated the correlation matrix using the `corr()` method.
- Created a heatmap to visualize the correlation matrix.
- Saved the heatmap to the specified directory and closed the figure.
