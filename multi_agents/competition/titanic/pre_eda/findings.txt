    Key Findings from Preliminary EDA:
    1. The training dataset contains 891 rows and 12 columns, while the test dataset contains 418 rows and 11 columns.
    2. There are missing values in the 'Age', 'Cabin', and 'Embarked' columns in the training dataset.
    3. The 'Survived' column is the target variable with 0 indicating not survived and 1 indicating survived.
    4. The 'Pclass', 'Sex', and 'Embarked' columns are categorical features.
    5. The 'Age', 'Fare', 'SibSp', and 'Parch' columns are numerical features.
    6. The distribution of the target variable 'Survived' shows that more passengers did not survive.
    7. Initial correlation analysis shows that 'Fare' and 'Pclass' have some correlation with 'Survived'.
    
    Potential Areas for Further Investigation:
    1. Investigate the impact of missing values and decide on appropriate imputation methods.
    2. Explore feature engineering opportunities, such as creating new features from existing ones.
    3. Perform in-depth analysis of the relationship between 'Survived' and other features.
    4. Consider interactions between features and their combined effect on survival.
