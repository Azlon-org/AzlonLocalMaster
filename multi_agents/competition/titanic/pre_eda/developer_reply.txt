Great! Now that I have the features and sample data from both the training and test datasets, I can proceed with the Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis. Let's break down the steps and implement them one by one.

### STEP 1: Load the Dataset and Display the First Few Rows

#### THOUGHT PROCESS
- Load the training and test datasets into pandas DataFrames.
- Display the first few rows of each dataset to get an initial sense of the data.

#### CODE
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the datasets
train_data_path = '/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/titanic/train.csv'
test_data_path = '/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/titanic/test.csv'

train_df = pd.read_csv(train_data_path)
test_df = pd.read_csv(test_data_path)

# Display the first few rows of the training dataset
print("Training Data:")
print(train_df.head())

# Display the first few rows of the test dataset
print("\nTest Data:")
print(test_df.head())
```

#### EXPLANATION
- The code loads the training and test datasets from the specified file paths.
- It then displays the first few rows of each dataset to provide an initial overview of the data.

### STEP 2: Use Summary Statistics to Understand the Distribution of Numerical Features

#### THOUGHT PROCESS
- Use the `describe()` method to generate summary statistics for numerical features in both datasets.
- This will help understand the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the datasetâ€™s distribution.

#### CODE
```python
# Summary statistics for numerical features in the training dataset
print("Summary Statistics for Training Data:")
print(train_df.describe())

# Summary statistics for numerical features in the test dataset
print("\nSummary Statistics for Test Data:")
print(test_df.describe())
```

#### EXPLANATION
- The `describe()` method provides summary statistics for numerical features, including count, mean, standard deviation, min, max, and quartiles.

### STEP 3: Generate Frequency Tables for Categorical Features

#### THOUGHT PROCESS
- Identify categorical features in the dataset.
- Generate frequency tables for these features to understand their distribution.

#### CODE
```python
# Identify categorical features
categorical_features = ['Pclass', 'Sex', 'SibSp', 'Parch', 'Embarked']

# Generate frequency tables for categorical features in the training dataset
print("Frequency Tables for Categorical Features in Training Data:")
for feature in categorical_features:
    print(f"\n{feature} Frequency Table:")
    print(train_df[feature].value_counts())

# Generate frequency tables for categorical features in the test dataset
print("\nFrequency Tables for Categorical Features in Test Data:")
for feature in categorical_features:
    print(f"\n{feature} Frequency Table:")
    print(test_df[feature].value_counts())
```

#### EXPLANATION
- The code identifies categorical features and generates frequency tables for these features in both the training and test datasets.

### STEP 4: Visualize the Data Using Histograms, Bar Plots, and Box Plots

#### THOUGHT PROCESS
- Use visualization libraries like matplotlib and seaborn to create histograms, bar plots, and box plots.
- This will help identify patterns and outliers in the data.

#### CODE
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Set the style for the plots
sns.set(style="whitegrid")

# Histograms for numerical features in the training dataset
numerical_features = ['Age', 'Fare']

for feature in numerical_features:
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    sns.histplot(train_df[feature].dropna(), kde=True)
    plt.title(f'Histogram of {feature}')
    plt.savefig(f'/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/titanic/pre_eda/images/histogram_{feature}.png')
    plt.show()

# Bar plots for categorical features in the training dataset
for feature in categorical_features:
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    sns.countplot(x=feature, data=train_df)
    plt.title(f'Bar Plot of {feature}')
    plt.savefig(f'/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/titanic/pre_eda/images/barplot_{feature}.png')
    plt.show()

# Box plots for numerical features in the training dataset
for feature in numerical_features:
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    sns.boxplot(x='Survived', y=feature, data=train_df)
    plt.title(f'Box Plot of {feature} by Survival')
    plt.savefig(f'/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/titanic/pre_eda/images/boxplot_{feature}_by_survival.png')
    plt.show()
```

#### EXPLANATION
- The code creates histograms for numerical features, bar plots for categorical features, and box plots to show the distribution of numerical features by survival status.
- The plots are saved in the specified directory with meaningful names.

### STEP 5: Check for Missing Values and Understand Their Distribution

#### THOUGHT PROCESS
- Check for missing values in both datasets.
- Understand the distribution of missing values across the dataset.

#### CODE
```python
# Check for missing values in the training dataset
print("Missing Values in Training Data:")
print(train_df.isnull().sum())

# Check for missing values in the test dataset
print("\nMissing Values in Test Data:")
print(test_df.isnull().sum())
```

#### EXPLANATION
- The code checks for missing values in both the training and test datasets and prints the count of missing values for each feature.

### FINAL STEP: Assert Statements to Verify the Correctness

#### THOUGHT PROCESS
- Use assert statements to verify the correctness of the code segments and the successful execution of the Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis.

#### CODE
```python
# Assert that the training and test datasets are not empty
assert not train_df.empty, "Training dataset is empty!"
assert not test_df.empty, "Test dataset is empty!"

# Assert that the data types of specific columns meet expectations
assert train_df['Survived'].dtype == 'int64', "Survived column is not of type int64!"
assert train_df['Pclass'].dtype == 'int64', "Pclass column is not of type int64!"
assert train_df['Age'].dtype in ['float64', 'int64'], "Age column is not of type float64 or int64!"
assert train_df['Fare'].dtype == 'float64', "Fare column is not of type float64!"

print("All checks passed successfully!")
```

#### EXPLANATION
- The code includes assert statements to ensure that the datasets are not empty and that the data types of specific columns meet expectations.

By following these steps, we have successfully completed the Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis. The next step would be Data Cleaning, where we will handle missing values, correct data types, and address any data quality issues identified during the EDA.
