Great, let's proceed with the Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis (Preliminary EDA) based on the provided plan. We'll start with the first task: loading and inspecting the dataset.

### TASK 1: Load and Inspect the Dataset

#### Thought Process
1. Load the `train.csv` and `test.csv` files using pandas.
2. Display the first few rows of each dataset using the `head()` method to get an initial look at the data.
3. Check the dimensions of the datasets using the `shape` attribute to understand the size of the data.

#### Code

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the datasets
train_path = '/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/titanic/train.csv'
test_path = '/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/titanic/test.csv'

train_df = pd.read_csv(train_path)
test_df = pd.read_csv(test_path)

# Display the first few rows of each dataset
print("First few rows of the training dataset:")
print(train_df.head())

print("\nFirst few rows of the test dataset:")
print(test_df.head())

# Check the dimensions of the datasets
print("\nDimensions of the training dataset:", train_df.shape)
print("Dimensions of the test dataset:", test_df.shape)
```

#### Explanation
- We use `pandas` to load the CSV files into DataFrames.
- The `head()` method is used to display the first few rows of each dataset to get an initial look at the data.
- The `shape` attribute is used to check the dimensions (number of rows and columns) of the datasets.

### TASK 2: Understand the Data Types and Basic Statistics

#### Thought Process
1. Use the `info()` method to get an overview of the data types and non-null counts.
2. Use the `describe()` method to get summary statistics for numerical features.

#### Code

```python
# Understand the data types and basic statistics
print("\nInformation about the training dataset:")
print(train_df.info())

print("\nSummary statistics of the training dataset:")
print(train_df.describe())

print("\nInformation about the test dataset:")
print(test_df.info())

print("\nSummary statistics of the test dataset:")
print(test_df.describe())
```

#### Explanation
- The `info()` method provides an overview of the data types and the number of non-null values in each column.
- The `describe()` method provides summary statistics (e.g., mean, standard deviation, min, max) for numerical features.

### TASK 3: Identify Missing Values

#### Thought Process
1. Use the `isnull()` method combined with `sum()` to count missing values in each column.
2. Visualize missing values using a heatmap (e.g., seaborn's heatmap).

#### Code

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Identify missing values
print("\nMissing values in the training dataset:")
print(train_df.isnull().sum())

print("\nMissing values in the test dataset:")
print(test_df.isnull().sum())

# Visualize missing values using a heatmap
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
sns.heatmap(train_df.isnull(), cbar=False, cmap='viridis')
plt.title('Missing Values in Training Dataset')
plt.savefig('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/titanic/pre_eda/images/missing_values_train.png')
plt.show()

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
sns.heatmap(test_df.isnull(), cbar=False, cmap='viridis')
plt.title('Missing Values in Test Dataset')
plt.savefig('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/titanic/pre_eda/images/missing_values_test.png')
plt.show()
```

#### Explanation
- The `isnull()` method combined with `sum()` counts the number of missing values in each column.
- A heatmap is used to visualize the missing values, making it easier to identify patterns of missing data.

### TASK 4: Explore Categorical Features

#### Thought Process
1. Use the `value_counts()` method to get the distribution of categorical features.
2. Visualize the distribution of categorical features using bar plots.

#### Code

```python
# Explore categorical features
categorical_features = ['Sex', 'Embarked', 'Pclass']

for feature in categorical_features:
    print(f"\nDistribution of {feature} in the training dataset:")
    print(train_df[feature].value_counts())
    
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 4))
    sns.countplot(data=train_df, x=feature)
    plt.title(f'Distribution of {feature} in Training Dataset')
    plt.savefig(f'/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/titanic/pre_eda/images/{feature}_distribution_train.png')
    plt.show()
```

#### Explanation
- The `value_counts()` method is used to get the distribution of categorical features.
- Bar plots are used to visualize the distribution of categorical features.

### TASK 5: Explore Numerical Features

#### Thought Process
1. Plot histograms for numerical features to understand their distributions.
2. Use box plots to identify potential outliers in numerical features.

#### Code

```python
# Explore numerical features
numerical_features = ['Age', 'Fare', 'SibSp', 'Parch']

for feature in numerical_features:
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 4))
    train_df[feature].hist(bins=30)
    plt.title(f'Distribution of {feature} in Training Dataset')
    plt.xlabel(feature)
    plt.ylabel('Frequency')
    plt.savefig(f'/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/titanic/pre_eda/images/{feature}_histogram_train.png')
    plt.show()
    
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 4))
    sns.boxplot(data=train_df, x=feature)
    plt.title(f'Box Plot of {feature} in Training Dataset')
    plt.savefig(f'/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/titanic/pre_eda/images/{feature}_boxplot_train.png')
    plt.show()
```

#### Explanation
- Histograms are used to understand the distribution of numerical features.
- Box plots are used to identify potential outliers in numerical features.

### TASK 6: Examine Relationships Between Features and the Target Variable

#### Thought Process
1. Use `groupby()` and `mean()` to explore the relationship between categorical features and the target variable (Survived).
2. Use scatter plots or pair plots to examine relationships between numerical features and the target variable.

#### Code

```python
# Examine relationships between features and the target variable
for feature in categorical_features:
    print(f"\nSurvival rate by {feature}:")
    print(train_df[[feature, 'Survived']].groupby(feature).mean())
    
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 4))
    sns.barplot(data=train_df, x=feature, y='Survived')
    plt.title(f'Survival Rate by {feature}')
    plt.savefig(f'/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/titanic/pre_eda/images/survival_rate_by_{feature}.png')
    plt.show()

# Scatter plots for numerical features
for feature in numerical_features:
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 4))
    sns.scatterplot(data=train_df, x=feature, y='Survived')
    plt.title(f'Survival by {feature}')
    plt.savefig(f'/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/titanic/pre_eda/images/survival_by_{feature}.png')
    plt.show()
```

#### Explanation
- The `groupby()` and `mean()` methods are used to explore the relationship between categorical features and the target variable.
- Bar plots visualize the survival rate by categorical features.
- Scatter plots examine the relationship between numerical features and the target variable.

This completes the Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis (Preliminary EDA) phase. The next step will be Data Cleaning.
