            "Agent Planner": "The plan is comprehensive and well-structured, covering all essential aspects of Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis. However, it could be improved by including a step to visualize the relationships between categorical features and the target variable (e.g., survival rate by class, sex, and embarkation point). This would provide more insights into the data and help identify important features early on."

### Evaluation Summary:
- **Strengths**: The plan is detailed, clear, and covers all necessary tasks for Preliminary EDA. It includes specific methods and code snippets, making it easy to follow.
- **Areas for Improvement**: Adding a step to visualize the relationships between categorical features and the target variable would enhance the initial insights and guide further analysis more effectively.

However, it would be beneficial to include comments throughout the code to explain each step, especially for more complex operations. Additionally, consider adding error handling for file loading and data processing steps to make the code more robust."

### Evaluation Summary:
- **Strengths**: The code is well-structured and implements the plan effectively. It includes all necessary steps and corrects an issue with the correlation matrix calculation.
- **Areas for Improvement**: Adding comments to explain each step would improve code readability. Including error handling for file loading and data processing would make the code more robust and user-friendly.
