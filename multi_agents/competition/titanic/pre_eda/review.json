        "agent planner": "The plan is comprehensive and well-structured, covering all essential aspects of Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis. However, it could be improved by including a step to visualize the relationships between categorical features and the target variable (e.g., survival rate by class, sex, and embarkation point). This would provide more insights into the data and help identify important features early on.",
        "agent developer": "The implementation is thorough and follows the plan closely. However, it would be beneficial to include comments throughout the code to explain each step, especially for more complex operations. Additionally, consider adding error handling for file loading and data processing steps to make the code more robust."
