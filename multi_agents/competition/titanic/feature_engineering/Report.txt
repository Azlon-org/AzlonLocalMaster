# Summary Report: Feature Engineering Step

## 1. Current Step Being Performed
The current step being performed is Feature Engineering for the Titanic data science competition.

## 2. Plan Designed by the Planner to Complete This Step
### Objectives:
1. Create new features or transform existing ones to improve the performance of the machine learning model.
2. Leverage insights from the In-depth EDA to generate features that capture important patterns and relationships in the data.

### Specific Tasks and Methods:
1. **Create New Features Based on Domain Knowledge**
   - **Family Size**: Create a new feature `FamilySize` by combining `SibSp` and `Parch` (i.e., `FamilySize = SibSp + Parch + 1`).
   - **IsAlone**: Create a binary feature `IsAlone` to indicate if a passenger is traveling alone (i.e., `IsAlone = 1` if `FamilySize == 1`, else `IsAlone = 0`).
   - **Title Extraction**: Extract titles from the `Name` column and create a new feature `Title`.

2. **Handle Categorical Variables**
   - **Label Encoding**: Apply label encoding to ordinal categorical features such as `Pclass`.
   - **One-Hot Encoding**: Apply one-hot encoding to nominal categorical features such as `Sex`, `Embarked`, and `Title`.

3. **Feature Interactions**
   - **Age*Class**: Create a new feature by multiplying `Age` and `Pclass` (i.e., `Age*Class = Age * Pclass`).
   - **Fare per Person**: Create a new feature `FarePerPerson` by dividing `Fare` by `FamilySize`.

4. **Handle Missing Values in Features**
   - **Age**: Use median or mean imputation for missing `Age` values.
   - **Embarked**: Use mode imputation for missing `Embarked` values.
   - **Fare**: Use median imputation for missing `Fare` values.

5. **Feature Scaling**
   - **Standardization**: Apply standardization (z-score normalization) to features like `Age`, `Fare`, and `FarePerPerson`.

6. **Documenting the Process**
   - **Code Comments**: Include comments in the code to explain the purpose of each feature transformation.
   - **Notebook Documentation**: Use markdown cells in Jupyter Notebooks to describe the rationale behind each feature engineering step.

### Dependencies, Resource Availability, and Time Constraints:
- **Dependencies**: The feature engineering step depends on the insights gained from the In-depth EDA. Ensure that all necessary data preprocessing steps (e.g., handling missing values) are completed before proceeding.
- **Resource Availability**: Utilize available computational resources efficiently. Leverage Kaggle Notebooks for free GPU access if needed.
- **Time Constraints**: Allocate sufficient time for iterative experimentation and validation of new features. Ensure that the feature engineering process is completed within the project timeline.

### Adaptability:
- **Unforeseen Challenges**: Be prepared to revisit and refine features based on model performance and validation results. Maintain flexibility to incorporate new insights or address issues as they arise.

## 3. Detailed Account of How the Developer Implemented the Plan
### Task 1: Create New Features Based on Domain Knowledge
#### Method:
- Created `FamilySize` by combining `SibSp` and `Parch`.
- Created `IsAlone` as a binary feature indicating if a passenger is traveling alone.
- Extracted `Title` from the `Name` column.

#### Code:
```python
# Create FamilySize feature
train_df_fe['FamilySize'] = train_df_fe['SibSp'] + train_df_fe['Parch'] + 1
test_df_fe['FamilySize'] = test_df_fe['SibSp'] + test_df_fe['Parch'] + 1

# Create IsAlone feature
train_df_fe['IsAlone'] = (train_df_fe['FamilySize'] == 1).astype(int)
test_df_fe['IsAlone'] = (test_df_fe['FamilySize'] == 1).astype(int)

# Extract Title from Name
train_df_fe['Title'] = train_df_fe['Name'].str.extract(' ([A-Za-z]+)\\.', expand=False)
test_df_fe['Title'] = test_df_fe['Name'].str.extract(' ([A-Za-z]+)\\.', expand=False)
```

### Task 2: Handle Categorical Variables
#### Method:
- Applied label encoding to `Pclass`.
- Applied one-hot encoding to `Sex`, `Embarked`, and `Title`.

#### Code:
```python
# Label Encoding for Pclass
label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
train_df_fe['Pclass'] = label_encoder.fit_transform(train_df_fe['Pclass'])
test_df_fe['Pclass'] = label_encoder.transform(test_df_fe['Pclass'])

# One-Hot Encoding for Sex, Embarked, Title
train_df_fe = pd.get_dummies(train_df_fe, columns=['Sex', 'Embarked', 'Title'], drop_first=True)
test_df_fe = pd.get_dummies(test_df_fe, columns=['Sex', 'Embarked', 'Title'], drop_first=True)
```

### Task 3: Feature Interactions
#### Method:
- Created `Age*Class` by multiplying `Age` and `Pclass`.
- Created `FarePerPerson` by dividing `Fare` by `FamilySize`.

#### Code:
```python
# Create Age*Class feature
train_df_fe['Age*Class'] = train_df_fe['Age'] * train_df_fe['Pclass']
test_df_fe['Age*Class'] = test_df_fe['Age'] * test_df_fe['Pclass']

# Create FarePerPerson feature
train_df_fe['FarePerPerson'] = train_df_fe['Fare'] / train_df_fe['FamilySize']
test_df_fe['FarePerPerson'] = test_df_fe['Fare'] / test_df_fe['FamilySize']
```

### Task 4: Handle Missing Values in Features
#### Method:
- Imputed missing values for `Age` and `Fare` using the median.
- Imputed missing values for `Embarked` using the mode.

#### Code:
```python
# Impute missing values for Age, Fare, Embarked
imputer_median = SimpleImputer(strategy='median')
imputer_mode = SimpleImputer(strategy='most_frequent')

train_df_fe['Age'] = imputer_median.fit_transform(train_df_fe[['Age']])
test_df_fe['Age'] = imputer_median.transform(test_df_fe[['Age']])

train_df_fe['Fare'] = imputer_median.fit_transform(train_df_fe[['Fare']])
test_df_fe['Fare'] = imputer_median.transform(test_df_fe[['Fare']])

train_df_fe['Embarked'] = imputer_mode.fit_transform(train_df_fe[['Embarked']]).ravel()
test_df_fe['Embarked'] = imputer_mode.transform(test_df_fe[['Embarked']]).ravel()
```

### Task 5: Feature Scaling
#### Method:
- Applied standardization (z-score normalization) to `Age`, `Fare`, `FarePerPerson`, and `Age*Class`.

#### Code:
```python
# Standardize numerical features
scaler = StandardScaler()

numerical_features = ['Age', 'Fare', 'FarePerPerson', 'Age*Class']
train_df_fe[numerical_features] = scaler.fit_transform(train_df_fe[numerical_features])
test_df_fe[numerical_features] = scaler.transform(test_df_fe[numerical_features])
```

### Task 6: Documenting the Process
#### Method:
- Included comments in the code to explain the purpose of each feature transformation.
- Used markdown cells in Jupyter Notebooks to describe the rationale behind each feature engineering step.
