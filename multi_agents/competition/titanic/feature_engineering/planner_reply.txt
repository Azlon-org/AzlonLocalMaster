### Feature Engineering Plan

#### Task Objectives
The objective of the Feature Engineering step is to create new features or transform existing ones to improve the performance of the machine learning model. This involves leveraging insights from the In-depth EDA to generate features that capture important patterns and relationships in the data.

#### Specific Tasks and Methods

1. **Create New Features Based on Domain Knowledge**
   - **Task**: Generate new features that could potentially improve model performance.
   - **Method**:
     - **Family Size**: Create a new feature `FamilySize` by combining `SibSp` and `Parch` (i.e., `FamilySize = SibSp + Parch + 1`).
     - **IsAlone**: Create a binary feature `IsAlone` to indicate if a passenger is traveling alone (i.e., `IsAlone = 1` if `FamilySize == 1`, else `IsAlone = 0`).
     - **Title Extraction**: Extract titles from the `Name` column and create a new feature `Title`.

2. **Handle Categorical Variables**
   - **Task**: Convert categorical variables into numerical representations.
   - **Method**:
     - **Label Encoding**: Apply label encoding to ordinal categorical features such as `Pclass`.
     - **One-Hot Encoding**: Apply one-hot encoding to nominal categorical features such as `Sex`, `Embarked`, and `Title`.

3. **Feature Interactions**
   - **Task**: Create interaction features that capture relationships between existing features.
   - **Method**:
     - **Age*Class**: Create a new feature by multiplying `Age` and `Pclass` (i.e., `Age*Class = Age * Pclass`).
     - **Fare per Person**: Create a new feature `FarePerPerson` by dividing `Fare` by `FamilySize`.

4. **Handle Missing Values in Features**
   - **Task**: Impute missing values in features to ensure completeness.
   - **Method**:
     - **Age**: Use median or mean imputation for missing `Age` values.
     - **Embarked**: Use mode imputation for missing `Embarked` values.
     - **Fare**: Use median imputation for missing `Fare` values.

5. **Feature Scaling**
   - **Task**: Scale numerical features to ensure they are on a similar scale.
   - **Method**:
     - **Standardization**: Apply standardization (z-score normalization) to features like `Age`, `Fare`, and `FarePerPerson`.

6. **Documenting the Process**
   - **Task**: Ensure that the feature engineering process is well-documented.
   - **Method**:
     - **Code Comments**: Include comments in the code to explain the purpose of each feature transformation.
     - **Notebook Documentation**: Use markdown cells in Jupyter Notebooks to describe the rationale behind each feature engineering step.

#### Dependencies, Resource Availability, and Time Constraints
- **Dependencies**: The feature engineering step depends on the insights gained from the In-depth EDA. Ensure that all necessary data preprocessing steps (e.g., handling missing values) are completed before proceeding.
- **Resource Availability**: Utilize available computational resources efficiently. Leverage Kaggle Notebooks for free GPU access if needed.
- **Time Constraints**: Allocate sufficient time for iterative experimentation and validation of new features. Ensure that the feature engineering process is completed within the project timeline.

#### Adaptability
- **Unforeseen Challenges**: Be prepared to revisit and refine features based on model performance and validation results. Maintain flexibility to incorporate new insights or address issues as they arise.
